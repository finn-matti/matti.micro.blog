I especially question their handling of international keyboards.

You see, on an international keyboard like [the German one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_keyboard_layout) the keyboard shortcuts `cmd + shift + 7` and `cmd + /` are virtually the same, because there is no way to type a `/` without typing `shift + 7`.[^1]\n\nTo my knowledge the only modern IDE that offers a default keymap for macOs that doesn't work out of the box with my default international keyboard is Jetbrain's offering.

Why the scope is not implied? I don&rsquo;t know.

If you look at <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/functions/\">the list of available functions in hugo</a>, you will know that a function was exported, but not why. Also a lot of functions were not exported, but you also do not know why. I assume that the lower case functions are all part of hugo&rsquo;s templating standard lib. But it&rsquo;s not explained what is going on in the docs explicitly.</li>\n<li><code> </code> - A space (yup).

The <code>ByDate.Reverse</code> part is used (and available only) on <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/templates/lists/#what-is-a-list-page-template\">list pages</a> - another detail you&rsquo;ll have to know - that is pages that have other pages under them in the file hierarchy. AND that the homepage is a special kind of list page. This is a snippet from the home page, so you can use it here to change the order of the retrieved array. Why you can&rsquo;t retrieve pages in similar manner on non list pages is unclear to me.</li>\n<li><code>&quot;Type&quot;</code> - This is the key parameter of the <code>where</code> function. The key is &ldquo;Type&rdquo; here. Why is <code>Type</code> capitalized? Maybe it has to because of exports? Maybe it&rsquo;s some other reason that I don&rsquo;t know. In any case it is part of the keys of the element that is kept (or discarded). For the pages array an element includes things like a <code>Permalink</code>, a published <code>Date</code> and a also a <code>Type</code>. How do you know what an element includes? Well, it&rsquo;s hard to say, because the <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/templates/template-debugging/#what-variables-are-available-in-this-context\">proposed solution</a> to use something like <code>&amp;#123;&amp;#123; printf &quot;%#v&quot; . }}</code> within a range function call that references the pages from the <code>Paginator</code> above only prints garbage. An actual solution is to use <code>&lt;pre&gt;&amp;#123;&amp;#123; . | jsonify (dict &quot;indent&quot; &quot; &quot;) }}&lt;/pre&gt;</code> which gives a pretty printed JSON representation of all the available properties within a given context. But you&rsquo;ll not find this solution in the docs, you have to get lucky and find it in the forum or <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64163573/how-to-inspect-variables-in-the-current-scope-in-hugo\">Stack Overflow</a>.</li>\n<li><code>&quot;post&quot;</code> - this is the match parameter of the <code>where</code> function.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I agree with Eric&rsquo;s point - <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2023/03/21/an-interesting-difference.html\">and have made a similar one recently</a> - just gathering and organizing information is not knowledge.</p>\n<p>However, I feel that Scotty seems to throw out the baby with the bath water: Just because PKM tools are limited doesn&rsquo;t mean that they are useless. Many people (like me) want or indeed <em>need</em>  <a href=\"https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5WDNZizsbAzE1p2BLwr339fV4TCpzNvaztP2\">a writing surface to think</a>. Finding a good writing surface makes a real difference and PKM tools can be an incredible writing surface.</p>\n<p>Does this make them &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; for PKM? First, what actually is a PKM tool? A notebook? A piece of paper? An index card? A word document? The current crop of fancy note taking tools like Obsidian et. al. are mostly more sophisticated versions of simpler PKM tools that came before them. So I&rsquo;d say if we just talk about &ldquo;tools that help turn data into information and in turn into knowledge&rdquo; (obviously not on their own, I&rsquo;ll have to engage with the stuff in front of me) then, I&rsquo;d say, they are indeed needed. If it is about the more sophisticated variants that have become popular over the last few years, then I think the question can be answered with a &ldquo;no, but&rdquo;. The &ldquo;but&rdquo; part here would make an argument about convenience but also elaborative power.</p>\n<p>It can be very convenient to use a modern tool like Obsidian and although not strictly neccessary, working with it is just very <em>nice</em>. As is using an iPhone (in my experience) or a sharp knife. Having a nice tool, makes me want to use the tool more, therefore engaging me with what I have gathered before, which in turn makes it more likely that I&rsquo;ll acquire knowledge in the process.</p>\n<p>More sophisticated PKM tools have, generally speaking, more elaborative power. If I can view and connect an idea in many different ways with ease, I am engaging with the information at hand, making it more easily retrievable. In other words these actions make it more likely I learn how it fits with other things I know already. This is what learning is: trying to understand, trying to get at the ideas behind the information and finding a &ldquo;fit&rdquo; within the greater universe of concepts and ideas I already know. If I have a tool, that makes the grunt work easier - like creating links, making my notes portable and so on - I can actually focus <em>more</em> on engaging with the interesting things I have collected. That&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m also not sure that the PKM concept itself is not recognizing the importance of actually engaging with my data, as is claimed. I believe that people are aware. I for example was not surprised that PKM should do more than &ldquo;just&rdquo; organize data (but was surprised that Scott would think knowledge workers that have heard of PKM aren&rsquo;t in the know) .

Rather, knowledge management is a process of transforming data into information and then into knowledge through the application of cognitive processes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While PKM tools can be helpful in collecting, organizing, and connecting the information you gather, it is up to you to do something with that information to turn it into knowledge.</p>\n<footer>Eric Gregorich <cite><a href=\"https://ericgregorich.com/2023/04/02/heyscottyj-no-pkm.html\" class=\"u-in-reply-to\">https://ericgregorich.com/2023/04/02/heyscottyj-no-pkm.html</a></cite></footer></blockquote><script src=\"https://micro.blog/quoteback.js\"></script>\n\nI agree with Eric's point - [and have made a similar one recently](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2023/03/21/an-interesting-difference.html) - just gathering and organizing information is not knowledge.\n\nHowever, I feel that Scotty seems to throw out the baby with the bath water: Just because PKM tools are limited doesn't mean that they are useless. Many people (like me) want or indeed _need_  [a writing surface to think](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5WDNZizsbAzE1p2BLwr339fV4TCpzNvaztP2). Finding a good writing surface makes a real difference and PKM tools can be an incredible writing surface.\n\nDoes this make them \"necessary\" for PKM? First, what actually is a PKM tool? A notebook? A piece of paper? An index card? A word document? The current crop of fancy note taking tools like Obsidian et. al. are mostly more sophisticated versions of simpler PKM tools that came before them. So I'd say if we just talk about \"tools that help turn data into information and in turn into knowledge\" (obviously not on their own, I'll have to engage with the stuff in front of me) then, I'd say, they are indeed needed. If it is about the more sophisticated variants that have become popular over the last few years, then I think the question can be answered with a \"no, but\". The \"but\" part here would make an argument about convenience but also elaborative power.\n\nIt can be very convenient to use a modern tool like Obsidian and although not strictly neccessary, working with it is just very _nice_. As is using an iPhone (in my experience) or a sharp knife. Having a nice tool, makes me want to use the tool more, therefore engaging me with what I have gathered before, which in turn makes it more likely that I'll acquire knowledge in the process.\n\nMore sophisticated PKM tools have, generally speaking, more elaborative power. If I can view and connect an idea in many different ways with ease, I am engaging with the information at hand, making it more easily retrievable. In other words these actions make it more likely I learn how it fits with other things I know already. This is what learning is: trying to understand, trying to get at the ideas behind the information and finding a \"fit\" within the greater universe of concepts and ideas I already know. If I have a tool, that makes the grunt work easier - like creating links, making my notes portable and so on - I can actually focus _more_ on engaging with the interesting things I have collected. That's a good thing.\n\nI'm also not sure that the PKM concept itself is not recognizing the importance of actually engaging with my data, as is claimed. I believe that people are aware. I for example was not surprised that PKM should do more than \"just\" organize data (but was surprised that Scott would think knowledge workers that have heard of PKM aren't in the know) . I still think that there is a good point in here, that got buried though: No matter the sophistication of the tools used to engage with gathered information: I'll have to do the leg work, which is what Eric took from it (and what I agree with).\n\nIn short: Sure, knowledge work doesn't _need_ sophisticated PKM tools, but it is tools that make knowledge, so I find it a little reductive to call a concept \"flawed\" and tools associated with it \"unneccessary\", especially if it has lots of things to recommend itself.\n\nP.S.: I would be on board with calling hype cycles around new technologies like \"more sophsticated PKM tools\" (or \"LLMs\" more recently) annoying, but these tools (both of them, actually) are not useless and shouldn't therefore be so easily dismissed.\n",

Meaning that you are actually not just getting rid of yet another veil that makes you see things more clearly - or on the contrary putting another mask on to make you see things less clearly. Instead your world can&rsquo;t literaly be anything else than what you focus on. If you&rsquo;re focussing on being happy, coping and so on, chances are that your world &ldquo;becomes&rdquo; what you see.</p>\n<p>This is not as simple as just using willpower, however. Not least, because willpower is like a muscle and ego depletion is a real thing. It&rsquo;s also because depression can be thought of as an an active but independently acting agent in your consciousness: Deciding to want to focus on something else is important, but a mental illness wouldn&rsquo;t be called that, if you could &lsquo;just decide&rsquo; and stick to counteracting it.</p>\n<p>This is where therapy can be incredibly helpful: In my experience visiting with a therapist changes your environment, your habits, which is itself - not even taking into account their skill at treating you - an important step to creating lasting behavioral change. But therapists offer also structure on top of just existing in your environment. In my experience they offer a source of serendipity that makes it possible to reach break throughs, new frames of thinking, new ways of looking at things. By showing up and interacting with a therapist you&rsquo;re making a real effort to change what you believe to be the boundaries of your current situation. Yes, this can be in the form of recipe-like  coping strategies, but it can also just mean to interact with an expert on mental health. And that communication has a very high likelihood of being <em>surprising</em> - which is so important to feel something, anything <em>else</em> as regards to your current mental health.</p>\n<p>So in short: We are and our world is what we are focussing on. There is no trick here. Nothing is revealed or hidden by engaging differently with the world, instead it is just that: A different perspective, a different world. To make a sustained effort to change this perspective for good means to change the environment (because willpower alone won&rsquo;t cut it) and to being open to be surprised.</p>\n<p>Medicine can really help in some cases. But even then it&rsquo;s not guaranteed that your conscience is built to accommodate even one new way of perceiving the world that doesn&rsquo;t include your mental illness. People are different, they can and can&rsquo;t do different things. A goal for one person to be completely healed from depression might just simply not be in the cards for others. <em>However</em>: Even temporary relief or a more manageable severity of symptoms might be totally worth the effort.</p>\n<p>Finally, there is no relief in thinking that you may never find relief and therefore doing nothing. I would like to say: Whole-ass the thing, but I don&rsquo;t mean it to say &ldquo;don&rsquo;t do anything else&rdquo;, I mean it in the sense that if you&rsquo;re doing therapy, take it seriously, treat is as a creative task.

Have a daily note, that logs what important things have happened that day. One thing per dash. I don't bother to log the time, because it's information I do not use (it also prevents redundancy). NB: I sometimes have only one or two things logged for that day. Logging too much just drowns out the actually important stuff.\n2. If there is more to say: Instead of writing paragraphs about the thing in the daily note, branch it out into its own note and leave a link at the dash.\n3. This is basically a special case of point 2: Always create a note for ongoing projects: Write down what you're doing in the project note. Use headings that link themselves back to the dailies - and link from the daily note to the project note: In this way you can see the progress made per project and don't clog up your dailies, while at the same time retaining a list of the things you did that day.\n4.

You may want to add an extra comment to those here and there, or an extra thing, like an observation for stuff that didn't get logged in the dailies but is deemed important enough to be remarked upon for the weekly.\n5. This pattern of taking the most important stuff from the dailies and putting it into the weeklies is repeated for each periodic note: The monthlies get populated by the weeklies, the quarterlies by the monthlies and the yearlies by the quarterlies.

				"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/01/01/year-of-strain.html\">Previously</a></p>\n<p>This last year was not a great year. I wouldn&rsquo;t say it was as bad as 2021. But it was a challenging year. 2022 was a year of increasing uncertainty. There was (and is) war happening very close by (or at least that&rsquo;s how it feels). There is the economic down turn, which touches everything and everyone around me.</p>\n<p>I look back and see a year that was defined by trying to get a grip, finally (for the umpteenth time). I was successful for a while, but almost nothing I tried to do stuck throughout the year (and beyond): I did not become a <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/05/29/taking-a-break.html\">microcaster</a>, an <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/categories/the-early-riser/\">early riser</a>, a <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/notes-on-notes/\">newsletter writer</a>, for example. Notable exceptions: Duolingo (500+ days streak) and my <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/categories/dailydogo/\">DailyDogo</a> series of posts here on the blog. I started a side project that I will claim is still ongoing, even though I have not invested any time into it since mid December.</p>\n<p>Now, not all projects are meant to be continuous, or even meant to succeed. I know that and it&rsquo;s fine. I do appreciate the insight gained from projects more than their outcomes. Nonetheless it is gnawing at me that I do not have a lot to show in terms of progress regarding my own ideas. I feel like I ought to be capable enough to make things (bring side projects to a &ldquo;version 1&rdquo; state, continuously publish side projects that are ongoing, like newsletters), change or add habits, transform my surroundings in a positive manner, etc. I feel like I should be able to succeed sometimes, at least.</p>\n<p>Let me say it again: Despite what I just wrote, I do appreciate that I have not stood still and it would be wrong to claim that nothing good came out of me trying hard in whatever it may have been. I just feel like that I would like to be able to show <em>something</em> for the effort, something tangible.</p>\n<p>Take my note taking system for example: For literal decades (only 2, but that still warrants the plural) I have honed and refined my skill to take notes, to think in notes and therefore am able to think many interesting thoughts beyond what a single &ldquo;thought session&rdquo; may come up with. I feel like this makes me good at my job. It actually makes me good at <em>life</em> I&rsquo;ll claim, because my reflections are more mature and I do know myself better than without. The question is though: If I&rsquo;m so great, where are the results of me being good? I&rsquo;m a middling programmer - I do recognize that I started my career later than others and I know that I have not reached my ceiling and am far from it: I even made steps forward to becoming more proficient. But still. I&rsquo;m an okay writer (or was) - not in English, mind you - but where are the publications? I&rsquo;m a pretty good thinker - but where are my contributions to a field, any field, that I have had academic training in (history, sociology, anthropology of science and technology and computer science)?</p>\n<p>It seems to me that I&rsquo;m caught in a stage of continuously drafting grand visions of my future if I look back through the many years of yearly reviews I have done. I&rsquo;m pretty sick of it. In 2022 I already made a change towards not changing my plans, but instead refining them. I count this as my biggest professional success. I made my peace with having a career in software development (now about 5 years in) and am trying to learn more about software architecture (only slightly successful, but nonetheless).</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>In my private life, our dog has been a great source of happiness. At the same time having a dog is challenging. My family lives about 2000 km away. My partner&rsquo;s family lives about 800 km away. So visits to either part of the family became much, much harder to organize and carry out. The same is true for vacations. Daily life with a dog is great, but it&rsquo;s not a neutral thing either: A dog warrants attention, love, decision making and so many different things. Your life will change and it will revolve around the dog a lot. This is maybe not surprising intellectually, but experientially it feels still much different than what it may have looked like beforehand. I do not regret having a dog, as hard as it was raising or quite simply dealing with her this year sometimes, but I won&rsquo;t say that everything was fine and easy going all the time either. Still, I love her like a crazy dog dad loves his fur child.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>We got engaged this year. We are now seven years together. I take this as a great sign that we are truly there for each other - through thick and thin. It was not an easy year. Lots of emotional support was needed. I&rsquo;m happy to say that I was able to give it, when I could. As an introvert - yep, that&rsquo;s true even when it comes to my partner - it wasn&rsquo;t always an easy thing to do, but I can look at myself in the mirror and honestly say that I tried hard in this regard. And I won&rsquo;t only complain, either: The vast vast VAST majority of our time together has been fun and something to look forward to. I love sharing my life with my favorite person and love having lots of memorable moments together.</p>\n<p>I have become a little rounder last year. Maybe two or three kilos - or is it five? A little grayer, too. I&rsquo;m 36 now. I feel like I&rsquo;m fine with my age and my looks. &ldquo;Not having anything to show for the effort&rdquo;-itis (see above) is surely a sign of getting older, I think and I do recognize that I&rsquo;m not super young anymore, but getting older is not worrying me. That&rsquo;s good. I think.</p>\n<p>So what will I remember from 2022? Our engagement for sure. How I got sick of grand plans maybe? That 2022 was economically a terrible year and I&rsquo;m happy that we were not too hard hit? Maybe that I tried hard on many occasions, despite any track record or tangible results?</p>\n<p>Maybe I will remember this year as a kind of beacon, like from a light house: On the one hand I had some insights that will surely inform my decision making next year. On the other hand, I came close at times to run aground in the shoals of actual lived adulthood. I have to be careful, but I also want to take heart: I&rsquo;m looking as ever hopeful into the future. Maybe I&rsquo;m able to not only claim a realistic approach next year but actually live one also.</p>\n",

I was successful for a while, but almost nothing I tried to do stuck throughout the year (and beyond): I did not become a [microcaster](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/05/29/taking-a-break.html), an [early riser](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/categories/the-early-riser/), a [newsletter writer](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/notes-on-notes/), for example. Notable exceptions: Duolingo (500+ days streak) and my [DailyDogo](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/categories/dailydogo/) series of posts here on the blog. I started a side project that I will claim is still ongoing, even though I have not invested any time into it since mid December.\n\nNow, not all projects are meant to be continuous, or even meant to succeed. I know that and it's fine. I do appreciate the insight gained from projects more than their outcomes. Nonetheless it is gnawing at me that I do not have a lot to show in terms of progress regarding my own ideas. I feel like I ought to be capable enough to make things (bring side projects to a \"version 1\" state, continuously publish side projects that are ongoing, like newsletters), change or add habits, transform my surroundings in a positive manner, etc. I feel like I should be able to succeed sometimes, at least.\n\nLet me say it again: Despite what I just wrote, I do appreciate that I have not stood still and it would be wrong to claim that nothing good came out of me trying hard in whatever it may have been. I just feel like that I would like to be able to show *something* for the effort, something tangible.\n\nTake my note taking system for example: For literal decades (only 2, but that still warrants the plural) I have honed and refined my skill to take notes, to think in notes and therefore am able to think many interesting thoughts beyond what a single \"thought session\" may come up with. I feel like this makes me good at my job. It actually makes me good at *life* I'll claim, because my reflections are more mature and I do know myself better than without. The question is though: If I'm so great, where are the results of me being good? I'm a middling programmer - I do recognize that I started my career later than others and I know that I have not reached my ceiling and am far from it: I even made steps forward to becoming more proficient. But still. I'm an okay writer (or was) - not in English, mind you - but where are the publications? I'm a pretty good thinker - but where are my contributions to a field, any field, that I have had academic training in (history, sociology, anthropology of science and technology and computer science)?\n\nIt seems to me that I'm caught in a stage of continuously drafting grand visions of my future if I look back through the many years of yearly reviews I have done. I'm pretty sick of it. In 2022 I already made a change towards not changing my plans, but instead refining them. I count this as my biggest professional success. I made my peace with having a career in software development (now about 5 years in) and am trying to learn more about software architecture (only slightly successful, but nonetheless).\n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/1a3f81d223.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 7608\" title=\"IMG_7608.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" />\n\nIn my private life, our dog has been a great source of happiness. At the same time having a dog is challenging. My family lives about 2000 km away. My partner's family lives about 800 km away. So visits to either part of the family became much, much harder to organize and carry out. The same is true for vacations. Daily life with a dog is great, but it's not a neutral thing either: A dog warrants attention, love, decision making and so many different things. Your life will change and it will revolve around the dog a lot. This is maybe not surprising intellectually, but experientially it feels still much different than what it may have looked like beforehand. I do not regret having a dog, as hard as it was raising or quite simply dealing with her this year sometimes, but I won't say that everything was fine and easy going all the time either. Still, I love her like a crazy dog dad loves his fur child.\n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/0fd5211ec6.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 7282\" title=\"IMG_7282.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" />\n\nWe got engaged this year. We are now seven years together. I take this as a great sign that we are truly there for each other - through thick and thin. It was not an easy year. Lots of emotional support was needed. I'm happy to say that I was able to give it, when I could. As an introvert - yep, that's true even when it comes to my partner - it wasn't always an easy thing to do, but I can look at myself in the mirror and honestly say that I tried hard in this regard. And I won't only complain, either: The vast vast VAST majority of our time together has been fun and something to look forward to. I love sharing my life with my favorite person and love having lots of memorable moments together.\n\nI have become a little rounder last year. Maybe two or three kilos - or is it five? A little grayer, too. I'm 36 now. I feel like I'm fine with my age and my looks. \"Not having anything to show for the effort\"-itis (see above) is surely a sign of getting older, I think and I do recognize that I'm not super young anymore, but getting older is not worrying me. That's good. I think.\n\nSo what will I remember from 2022? Our engagement for sure. How I got sick of grand plans maybe? That 2022 was economically a terrible year and I'm happy that we were not too hard hit? Maybe that I tried hard on many occasions, despite any track record or tangible results?\n\nMaybe I will remember this year as a kind of beacon, like from a light house: On the one hand I had some insights that will surely inform my decision making next year. On the other hand, I came close at times to run aground in the shoals of actual lived adulthood. I have to be careful, but I also want to take heart: I'm looking as ever hopeful into the future. Maybe I'm able to not only claim a realistic approach next year but actually live one also.\n",

When I scrolled through their explore timeline I was surprised to find a post by fellow corgi lover and micro.blogger Hollie Butler (<a href=\"https://micro.blog/hollie\">@hollie</a>) that urged people to find a better instance, because mastodon.social has had a bad moderation for a long time.</p>\n<p>In the replies to this post a user asked: Can I move my content over to a new (e.g. better moderated) instance? The answer is no. You can move the people you follow, but not your content, it seems.</p>\n<p>With micro.blog this combination of problems doesn't really exist. On the one hand they have and enforce community guidelines that protect the community against hate speech, harassment and so on. Community manager Jean MacDonald (<a href=\"https://micro.blog/jean\">@jean</a>) does an excellent job as far as I can tell. So there is no reason to move. Micro.blog is just a blog hoster with a social timeline component.</p>\n<p>On the other hand exporting your data is easy enough, too. Even if there would be a reason at some point to move: I do own all my content and it's not useless content, because a micro.blog is just a blog and so the content I'd export are just blog posts.</p>\n<p>The point is: At the moment micro.blog seems like the ideal place that is not twitter, but has moderation figured out (and still lets you connect to mastodon users). I feel like I'm in good hands with them. If you're willing to fiddle, you can connect your own blog for free, or you could pay them 5$ a month and have everything set up for you. Connect a domain and you really truly own your content, even in the case you feel the need to move away, since the permalinks point to your domain not micro.blog's (<a href=\"https://help.micro.blog/t/moving-micro-blog-hosted-blog-to-self-hosted/1201\">I'm not claiming the moving blog hosters is easy, but it's possible…</a>).</p>\n",

Wether it is note taking or coding, gaming or just watching youtube: I really like to use my Mac more than I like my iPad. The iPad is strictly better for cooking and is used frequently for that, but I have not used the machine to its full potential. I have noticed that I'm a very stationary person and like my current desk setup (private laptop on the left, KVM-enabled Display in the middle, work laptop on the right, <a href=\"https://ergodox-ez.com/\">Ergodox EZ</a> as my keyboard and Logitech MX Master 3 as my mouse), which doesn't include a real place for an iPad. I rarely work on the kitchen table - the only other spot really usable for writing/sitting down to do computer things in my home. Even when I'm traveling it's the laptop not the tablet that gets used.</p>\n<p>That being said I'm happy about owning an iPad Pro, too. I use it frequently enough to make it worth the purchase, even if I'm a light user of it. Next time around I probably would get a cheaper, more basic model. The Air is just plainly a great computer and I can't even conceive a justification for wanting more out of a private computer (which gets used for 1 to 8 hours a day, depending on if it's the weekend or free time after work).</p>\n",

I didn’t “live” in my notes as much as I like to do.</p>\n<p>Another big reason for being fine with paying the price of maintaining things myself is the recent development of Obsidian: it now supports multiple windows, something that Agenda lacks and something that makes distilling a bunch of notes into a new one pretty hard.</p>\n<p>Finally, I think that working on plugins for Obsidian is a way to lessen the load of maintenance and - since I’m a developer - a way to actually gain some expertise. So in my case, it is not a terrible investment of time and effort.</p>\n<p> </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>The best feature is one that is provided and maintained by the platform. A feature that can be built using an API or through extensions/plugins is of course better than a feature that does not exist all. But: Building a feature means maintaining a feature.</p>\n<p>An example: You can cobble together a functioning journaling/project notes solution, with daily, weekly and other periodic notes in <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/02/27/good-apps-obsidian.html\">Obsidian</a> (using a handful of plugins and a carefully thought through file organization scheme). That works. You just have to remember how everything works the next time you touch that part of your setup. And hope that nothing breaks, between those loosely coupled building blocks and the next update. Or you could just use <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/08/22/good-apps-agenda.html\">Agenda</a>. Is Agenda perfect? No. But it is much more well suited out of the box for this kind of note taking.</p>\n<p>There is also a risk of drift: If you're trying to organize your notes, you probably don't do so just for the sake of it, but because you try to become better at doing other things. The notes and also the notes setup are just helping to accomplish a task at hand. If your setup is complicated and some parts are even written by yourself, you might end up accomplishing everything else but the task you set out to check off in the first place.</p>\n<p>Therefore, when I try to improve my current system, I always look for ways to use a less customized system. The more stock features I use the better. The burden of maintaining those features lies with the app developer.</p>\n<p>Of course, there will be lots of cases where a feature just doesn't exist. In that case I try to live without this feature first. Maybe I don't need it as much as I first thought. If I can't live without it, I look for a plugin solution, again, to lessen the maintenance load on myself. I have to be aware, that I may not need to maintain the plugin providing the feature, but I am now responsible to make it all work, i.e. the burden of maintenance of the integration of plugin and setup lies with me.</p>\n<p>Finally, I might write a plugin, script or customize an existing piece of code to make it do what I need it to do, but this is really a last resort. Very often this is not worth the time.</p>\n",

These are often literally the base of knowledge from which I work. Here I try to distill what I have learned and try to push myself toward the new and the more generalized.</li>\n<li>Project notes: Status quos, todos and thoughts related to ongoing projects or tasks that have some kind of momentum but are more ephemeral than timeless notes.</li>\n<li>Journal notes: Notes that record what is happening or has happened so that I have a written record of aspects of my lived life.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Types 2 and 3 are very much related, although different in the sense, that a type 2 note is not necessarily interesting enough to be mentioned in a type 3 note. And a type 3 note is not so concerned with creating or maintaining momentum, but more with creating a record of what happened.</p>\n<p>Type one notes are different in the sense that they should be more interlinked and add up to trees of notes that in turn act serendipity-enhancing on the interface between thinking and writing (including coding). You want to treat those kinds of notes differently and keep them separate. This is where the good stuff lives. Insights from type 2 and 3 notes might end up becoming a type 1 note.</p>\n<p>A type 1 note is not the place to keep a record, though. It represents my latest stance on a topic, the latest formulation of an idea. They exist to be refactored and to be changed in any way that seems appropriate.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I work as a programmer for my day job. Right now I am working on two php projects. Coming from <a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com\">Sublime Text</a> but having had the need for more IDE features I came to love <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com\">Visual Studio Code</a> and made it my home. VS Code is a great editor for PHP development, especially if you use the <a href=\"https://intelephense.com\">Intelephense</a> extension. However, the bigger the project, the more it becomes apparent, that the performance of the language server is not <em>that</em> great.</p>\n<p>I lived with this for many months now. Yesterday I started working on a new issue and thought to myself: “All of my dev team members use <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/\">Jetbrains PHPStorm</a>, I should give it a try.”. I had used <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/\">Jetbrains Intelij Idea</a> for a brief moment a while back and only remembered being fairly unimpressed, but not exactly why I felt that way. Having now tried getting into their PHP IDE product, I have to say my impression has not really changed and now I also remember why.</p>\n<p>Although the code intelligence performance is clearly better, it is the small stuff that gets me. The impetus for this post for example was that you can’t use standard shell shortcuts with the integrated terminal: <code>Control + R</code> (backwards history search) being one of my most often used commands.</p>\n<p>I appreciated that they offer a keymap for people coming from Code to PHPStorm and as far as I can tell, the commands in it work. But customizing an IDE is more than just having the same default shortcuts for common tasks available in the new app. I have a bunch of my own shortcuts in code that use the pattern <code>CMD + H &lt;Key&gt;</code> (press <code>CMD + H</code> and then <code>&lt;Key&gt;</code>). I use <code>CMD + H</code>, because my last name start with H, so it was (and is) easier to remember. It just so happens that <code>CMD + H</code> is also a system wide shortcut for hiding an application. So when I tried to set up a frequently used shortcut to reveal the currently opened file in the sidebar navigation, <code>CMD + H S</code> the PHPStorm app was just hidden. In other words it did not “shadow” or override system shortcuts when asked. This feels even more arbitrary if we take those two things together: On the one hand standard shortcuts of the shell running inside the integrated terminal are shadowed per default - and this can also not be disabled -  and on the other hand wanting to shadow a system wide shortcut like <code>CMD + H</code> is not possible without remapping the shortcut within the OS. I feel like the IDE is not really playing along, but instead makes me jump through hoops.</p>\n<p>These are only two compounding cuts of a thousand that make PHPStorm hard to love in my opinion. I have an especially hard time understanding the design decisions to remove long standing functionality from a shell by shadowing standard shortcuts. It’s just a bad idea. It does explain why my colleagues never use the integrated terminal, but have an extra shell window open to the side, to run terminal commands.</p>\n<p>All in all I am very unimpressed by PHPStorm, but also worried: If the performance of Intelephense stays as bad much longer, I might have to look at other options. I know that Netbeans and Eclipse also have PHP features, I just don’t know anyone using, let alone loving these apps for PHP development…</p>\n\n[Forward.](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2023/07/10/phpstorms-keybinding-system.html)\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I recently bought new hardware for my personal use: An M1 MacBook Air and an 11” iPad Pro. My thoughts after the keynote:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I couldn’t be more excited about the new iPadOS features</li>\n<li>I am slightly sad that the two new MacBook models - the new M2 MacBook Air and the new 13-inch MacBook Pro - would have been options for my needs and budget</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since the iPad Pro was supposed to be my main machine - not least because I wanted to see if that is possible and fun - I’m even more excited to double down on that. Yeah, I just bought the older MacBook Air, but I bought it because I assume that the light coding I’m doing in my free time and the heavier reading/writing/note taking/processing workflow I have, will lead me to use a machine that can run a less walled in OS with multitasking capabilities. We’ll see.</p>\n<p>I wonder if I would have picked a beefier M2 Air over my two machine solution, but I’m also happy I got both devices. We live in a time of exciting technology in which we can pick the right digital tool for the job at hand and I’m happy that I can experience this exciting future.</p>\n<p>In any case: My new hardware - I’m still waiting on my new Air - is/is going to be an amazing upgrade to my technological status quo. My personal laptop has been a 13-inch Mac Pro from 2013. And although that computer is still working (I just upgraded it to Monterey this morning!), it was time to upgrade. I’m really looking forward to leaving the sluggish, syrupy Mac experience behind.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/10/24/previously-after-using.html\">My thoughts after a few months of use</a></p>\n",

It is an event that can interact with me and potentially makes me do things. It’s a trigger (or cue).</p>\n<p>Notifications can be desirable, overwhelming, unhelpful or outright spam. They are not inherently good or bad, but they are not a neutral thing in the world either: They make a difference.</p>\n<p>Judging the usefulness of a notification is a involved process. The complexity of getting notifications right increases when realizing that you have to set them up beforehand, which means you have to expect the future.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1.whatdoyounotwanttomiss-notwantingtomisssomethingdoesn’tmeanyouneedtoknowaboutitimmediately.\">1.

A window of obligation/opportunity opened (or is about to close). Something was like <em>this</em> now it’s like <em>that</em>. Depending on the change, I might be interested in it forever or only for a limited period. In either case, time sensitivity itself is not the same as a change of state.

Sometimes it needs to be known depending on a location or on a certain date and time. “Now” is one, but not the only possibility. The reasons for a notification being time sensitive can be manifold in practice. Abstractly speaking, it is a question of priority and urgency - which are also not the same thing.</p>\n<p>Whilst priority is trying to rank items by importance (which itself is a relative measure of impactfulness of the thing in question) to my world, urgency re-ranks those items according to currently open windows of opportunity and/or obligation.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Not only is it hard to keep all these distinctions in mind when I’m trying to predict my future, I’m also prone to getting it wrong, because my world is not made of numbers.

So I try that first for any app that actually really needs to inform me.</p>\n<p>The harder part of this heuristic is figuring out what the least distracting thing is. I find a badge count of the right measure to be pretty good.

				"content_text": "<p>I recently published a post about my <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/05/15/my-microcasts.html\">microcasts</a> and I‘m now writing this to tell you I’m going to microcast less. Less frequent and less scheduled. This is even weirder because I just created an intricate shortcut that automatically publishes a post with the right episode title and number without having to look up any of those details, which streamlined the entire process a lot.</p>\n\n<p>But I have noticed that I‘m not as much in the mood at the moment to record my thoughts in this way. <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/categories/the-early-riser/\">The early riser project</a>, for example, was a great McGuffin to get me out of bed, but since I have changed my approach to waking up, it has become less important to me. I don‘t want to record these little episodes for the ramblings alone.</p>\n\n<p>Being a big fan of podcasts like <a href=\"https://www.backtowork.limo\">Back To Work</a> and <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/cortex\">Cortex</a>, I thought I could do a microcast about my work and how I approach it, but I have noticed that I would like to write about these things, not only talk about them extemporaenously. LeadDev is also the microcast for which the ratio of recorded/published episodes is the worst: I take this as an indicator of my wanting to express myself more carefully than I can while walking the dog and having to observe the environment.</p>\n\n<p>À propos the dog: I created my first microcast, the PuppyCast, because I wanted to have a record of the challenges and joys of raising a puppy. I wanted to look (<a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/categories/dailydogo/\">DailyDoogo</a>, which I will not abandon, btw.) and listen back to this important time in my life. But I think that this project has run its course: I don‘t feel the need to publish this every week anymore. It‘s not like nothing changes or that there is nothing to report dog-wise, but it all comes down to the need to simplify and de-schedule my life. And I have episodes for the first six months, which seems like a good place to stop.</p>\n\n<p>Seasons change. And this is how I feel about my microcasting: Right now I‘d much rather write than talk. Looking at my blog I mostly see noise that was produced hastily to satisfy a self-imposed schedule. I will let this stuff go, for now.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><a href=\"https://obsidian.md\">Obsidian</a> is a personal knowledge base and note taking app with a lot of flexibility and extensions that make it very powerful. If you like to <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/01/23/notes-on-notes.html\">take notes</a> and be in control of your data, then Obsidian might be the right fit.</p>\n<p>What makes Obsidian so valuable for me is that it allows me to consolidate a lot of things into one app. Like information about a project and its tasks. Reference materials about sociology and solutions to programming problems. Everything can be made to fit into Obsidian and thanks to its extensibility and configurability, the app can be adapted to my evolving needs over time.</p>\n<p>Most people point out that Obsidian is an app for people who like to <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/01/23/103518.html\">link their notes together</a>. If you rename a note in Obsidian, all the links to it will be renamed, too. Linking notes, so that they become chains and/or trees of notes unlocks emergent qualities that you wouldn’t be able to access without linking them.<a id=\"fnref:1\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"see footnote\" href=\"#fn:1\">[1]</a> It is also available as an iPhone app, that can do almost all the things that the Mac app can do. So you can take all your stuff with you as well.</p>\n<p>Obsidian might not be for you, because it might just be a little bit too much. But it might also just be the tool you were looking for. If you happen to have a tendency to react skeptically to overly hyped apps like this one: Ignore the knowledge graph visualization stuff<a id=\"fnref:2\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"see footnote\" href=\"#fn:2\">[2]</a> and also the personal knowledge base singularity talk and just try it out. Obsidian is great. Don’t let the sometimes overly boastful rhetoric in this space keep you from at least trying it.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\"><hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>For example: You will find notes that, taken together, inspire a new creative thought. You might also rediscover an old solution to a problem you currently have. Or you might notice a pattern in otherwise disparate information. <a class=\"reversefootnote\" title=\"return to article\" href=\"#fnref:1\"> ↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\">\n<p>I think that visualizing one’s notes <em>could</em> at some point be helpful for maintaining and refactoring, but we are not there, yet. <a class=\"reversefootnote\" title=\"return to article\" href=\"#fnref:2\"> ↩</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>In January I did a yearly Review and planning session, a thing I always try to do every year.</p>\n\n<p>This year I have the following goals and ideas which I'd like to try out:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Becoming an early riser - Status Quo: Big success! So much more time<sup><a href=\"#fn1-22434\" id=\"fnr1-22434\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> to do my projects. Se also my unter two minutes podcast <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/categories/the-early-riser/\">\"The Early Riser\"</a> that I record every single morning right after I have woken up.</li>\n<li>\"I will start\" - Explanation: Be the one who initiates communication, anticipate things to do before anybody has to bring them up - Status: Eh. Could be better, but I am not so bothered by this.</li>\n<li>Evidence-based living - Explanation: <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/01/19/080216.html\">Track things</a> and find metrics to make more informed decisions about different areas in my life.</li>\n<li>\"Commit\" - Explanation: Inspired by <a href=\"https://www.oliverburkeman.com/books\">4000 Weeks</a>, I'll try to commit to only three work-in-progress items at a time and if I'm committed try to bring those things to an end that is satisfactory while also resisting other demands - internally or externally - on me and my time and attention. Status: Okay, actually.</li>\n<li>\"Read and Write more\" - Status: Meh. I am trying, though. I found that playing around with <a href=\"https://readwise.io\">Readwise</a><sup><a href=\"#fn2-22434\" id=\"fnr2-22434\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> has motivated me to do more in this regard.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-22434\">\n<p>A day has only 24 Hours, so how is changing the start of the day making a difference? It's all about not snoozing and using time in bed effectively. If you need 10 hours in bed to get 6 hours of sleep that's not very effective. On the other hand: If you sleep 7 hours while laying in bed for 8 that's pretty good. Changing my sleep schedule made me a more effective sleeper. <a href=\"#fnr1-22434\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn2-22434\">\n<p>I can't decide if it's a great thing or overpriced, yet. [EDIT: <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/02/13/my-current-highlighting.html\">I have decided that I like it. A lot.</a>] But I have noticed the little boost of interest of doing more reading (and re-reading) with every resurfaced highlight. So maybe it'll end up being worth it. <a href=\"#fnr2-22434\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "If you are one of [the brave people](https://www.manton.org/2022/01/07/moving-to-new.html) that uses Hugo Version 0.91 and wants to take advantage of Hugo's [native syntax highlighting](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/) capabilities on a light theme (like the default theme in this example), you might be surprised:\n\n![](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/uploads/2022/f32609ded9.png)\n\nAs you can see… you can't really see much.\n\nThankfully this can be changed, by changing the configuration for syntax highlighting. But in order to do that you have to know the following:\n\n<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" data-title=\"\" data-author=\"Jason Cardwell\" data-avatar=\"https://micro.blog/Moondeer/avatar.jpg\" cite=\"https://micro.blog/Moondeer/12348161\"><p><a href=\"https://micro.blog/matti\">[@matti](https://micro.blog/matti)</a> interesting … so much is still a blackbox for me. I just tinker until I get results. My two favorite finds are the config directory (which take precedent ahead of the json files) and the assets directory (with which you can build Javascript and Sass files from templates).</p>\n<footer>Jason Cardwell <cite><a href=\"https://micro.blog/Moondeer/12348161\">https://micro.blog/Moondeer/12348161</a></cite></footer></blockquote><script src=\"https://micro.blog/quoteback.js\"></script>\n\nYou have to know about the precedence because for some reason, changing the config.json in your theme won't do the trick. This is how it works:\n\n## Get A Functioning Custom \"New-Plugin-Style\"-Default-Theme For Your Blog\n\nEDIT 18.02.2022: The following is not up to date anymore. Plugin-Themes now behave much more convenient: Just install the theme, activate for your blog, create a custom theme and only add `config/_default/markup.json` template.\n\n~~First of all make sure you are on the Hugo version 0.91 (dropdown in the Design screen, remember to save) and install the default theme as a plugin (Plug-ins screen). Then go to Design again and click on \"Edit Custom Themes\", on the next screen click on the default theme and duplicate it with the button in the next screen. You should now be back in the custom themes overview list. Click Design in the sidebar once more and choose your custom theme, save. Click \"Edit Custom Themes\" again and then on your copy of the Default theme.[^1]~~\n\n\n## Change Configuration\n\nYou should now be inside your custom theme screen. Click on \"New Template\". You will be presented wie the template editor and theme preview split view.\n\nName the template `config/_default/markup.json` and set its contents to:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"highlight\": {\n      \"anchorLineNos\": false,\n      \"codeFences\": true,\n      \"guessSyntax\": false,\n      \"hl_Lines\": \"\",\n      \"lineAnchors\": \"\",\n      \"lineNoStart\": 1,\n      \"lineNos\": true,\n      \"lineNumbersInTable\": true,\n      \"noClasses\": true,\n      \"style\": \"monokailight\",\n      \"tabWidth\": 4\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nThis is basically the [default config from the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration-markup#highlight), except that for style we use `monokailight` instead of `monokay`. Click \"Update Template\", your site should be rebuilding as indicated by the spinner. When Hugo is done, syntax highlighting should now be working as intended and the code be legible.\n\nExample:\n\n```go-html-template\n{{ define \"main\" }}\n<div class=\"home h-feed\">\n  <ul class=\"post-list\">\n  {{ $paginator := .Paginate (where (where .Site.RegularPages.ByDate.Reverse \"Type\" \"post\") \"Params.title\" \"!=\" nil   ) (index .Site.Params \"archive-paginate\" | default 25) }}\n  {{ range $paginator.Pages  }}\n      <li class=\"h-entry\">\n\t\t\t<h1><a href=\"{{ .Permalink }}\">{{ .Title }}</a></h1>\n\n        <a href=\"{{ .Permalink }}\" class=\"u-url\"><span class=\"post-meta\"><time class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"{{ .Date.Format \"2006-01-02 15:04:05 -0700\" }}\">{{ .Date.Format \"Jan 2, 2006\" }}</time></span></a>\n\n        <div class=\"e-content\">\n         \t{{ .Content }}\n        </div>\n      </li>\n    {{ end }}\n  </ul>\n\n  <p class=\"rss-subscribe\">subscribe <a href=\"{{ \"feed.xml\" | absURL }}\">via RSS</a></p>\n\n</div>\n{{ end }}\n```\n\n\n~~[^1]: I'm not sure if this is all necessary or even the right way to go about it. It seems pretty involved and I don't even know how you would migrate your customizations in an easy way if you happen to have used the old style of choosing a theme… but this way works, that much I could prove.~~\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I barely can watch movies anymore. This has less to do with problems of changing aesthetics and me being unable to adapt (, although maybe a little bit). It’s more about it getting harder and harder to suspend my disbelief. An example from last night: I tried to watch „Don’t look up“ but got so infuriated by the depiction of how things would supposedly work, that I couldn’t enjoy an otherwise interesting idea. I guess I just don’t like when a movie’s plotting is dependent on unrealistic premises, especially when it claims to start from a place of (somewhat heightened) realism. Things should make sense within the confines of its world. If our actual world builds the backbone of the movie’s world then you gotta show the work that’s happening why things are different than we normally would expect them to be. Show me the work. This is not the same as asking for everything to be explained. I am simply asking for potential plausibility. Handwaving in the right spots is of course part of storytelling.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe it’s because I have studied history of science and technology, have been working in the literature studies department while I was studying and am now working as a programmer that I am therefore primed to notice and dislike such inconsistencies. I prefer nonfiction, memoirs and sociologically interesting sci-fi. Works that do not reduce the interesting complexities of our world to tell a story that doesn’t shy away from the effort to be plausible.</p>\n\n<p>I think that this happens to me more frequently now, is because I am much more time- and attention-constrained. I do not have the resources after a long day to consume too many things that ask me to do the work of „making it work“. I also have less chances to consume anything at all the older I get and the more responsibilities I have and am therefore more discerning on what I spend my time on. „Tried and true“ is often the answer. So no wonder that watching sports have become such a big part of my life instead of artistic works. I also prefer a solid but consistent tv show over an at times brilliant but otherwise disappointing one. I assess consuming media more and more from a standpoint of how risky it is: How likely will I be disappointed? I already have lists of lists of things I would like to do. If I decide to try something new, it better be worth it. And: It seldom is.</p>\n\n<p>There is a ratcheting effect built in this way of consuming media: You do more and more of the same and less and less of the new. If it was only me I would even prefer such a bias, but it also has consequences for enjoying things like movies and tv shows together with my partner. So I end up giving chances to things I would have not considered. Maybe that’s good. Things shouldn’t be too predictable either. But boy, do many, many things suffer from a lack of plausibility…</p>\n",

The bigger the social structure you try to keep \"in order\" (like a gardener) the bigger the work. This is why suppression only works for self selected (or lucky), small groups with aligned interests and supporting structures (resources, established processes, a shared and actively maintained history<sup><a href=\"#fn2-8648\" id=\"fnr2-8648\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">2</a></sup>, …).

Not because I want to underline that Lucy was a family member (she totally was), but because it was not *my* dog. It was my dad's dog. I can't fault him, but it always hurt me a little. The way he told stories about his dog. The way he took his dog with him after the divorce. I got it and I get it. But this observation made me think \"I wanna have a dog, too!\"\n\nMany years passed where having a dog would have been impractical, irresponsible or outright impossible. I buried the idea for almost a decade. If I referred to this wish of mine I said \"When I'm 30 I'm gonna get a dog\". Getting closer to the end of my time at university, around 27, the wish resurfaced. Unclear where I was going to live and with what I was going to make my money, this little itch came back. I want a dog. And not just since yesterday. Now I'm 35. I feel like it's time.\n",

Those used to happen in comment sections spread across the internet. But now, places like Twitter or Instagram are acting as places for both the discovery and the consumption of new content.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A platform that only allows comments about content linked from elsewhere on the web will not lead to this kind of centralization. A comment-only platform like this is also much less convenient to use to actually build upon other people&rsquo;s content, which most often happens in the quoting (or linking) style instead the commenting-style of engagement.</p>\n<p>Making it easier to quote other people&rsquo;s content might on the other hand have consequences as regards to how we engage with the creators behind the content. Which brings me to another post of Manuel (<a href=\"https://manuelmoreale.com/the-internet-is-not-broken-people-are\">The internet is not broken. People are.</a>), which is that social media exposes a lot of people&rsquo;s interest not in doing the thing for the love of the thing, but for the fame, which might be achieved through it (Something I have always appreciated about <a href=\"https://micro.blog/merlinmann\">@merlinmann</a>: He does the things because he loves doing them).</p>\n<p>A commenter is not very likely to become famous through commenting. A quoter on the other hand produces first order content: This post here stands on its own, even though it is inspired by other content. Combined with the strong network effects of the big social media platforms, odds are that the wish for fame becomes more likely to surface - because fame itself is more probable in these conditions.</p>\n<p>Therefore offering tools for quoting, for building upon other people&rsquo;s content, is a double edged sword. If the social media platform is too big and quoting is too easy, there is an increased likelihood of a bloodless hunt for fame, in which first order creators become increasingly invisible to each other.</p>\n",

But now, places like Twitter or Instagram are acting as places for both the discovery and the consumption of new content.\n\nA platform that only allows comments about content linked from elsewhere on the web will not lead to this kind of centralization. A comment-only platform like this is also much less convenient to use to actually build upon other people's content, which most often happens in the quoting (or linking) style instead the commenting-style of engagement.\n\nMaking it easier to quote other people's content might on the other hand have consequences as regards to how we engage with the creators behind the content. Which brings me to another post of Manuel ([The internet is not broken. People are.](https://manuelmoreale.com/the-internet-is-not-broken-people-are)), which is that social media exposes a lot of people's interest not in doing the thing for the love of the thing, but for the fame, which might be achieved through it (Something I have always appreciated about [@merlinmann](https://micro.blog/merlinmann): He does the things because he loves doing them).\n\nA commenter is not very likely to become famous through commenting. A quoter on the other hand produces first order content: This post here stands on its own, even though it is inspired by other content. Combined with the strong network effects of the big social media platforms, odds are that the wish for fame becomes more likely to surface - because fame itself is more probable in these conditions.\n\nTherefore offering tools for quoting, for building upon other people's content, is a double edged sword. If the social media platform is too big and quoting is too easy, there is an increased likelihood of a bloodless hunt for fame, in which first order creators become increasingly invisible to each other.\n",

After the sudden death of her husband and the hospitalization of her daughter, Didion finds herself detached from reality and has to claw herself back to reason. There is a certain sharpness in the way she puts things, a certain breathlessness in the intelligence with which she follows the paths of her own thoughts while mourning the loss of a writing partner and spouse (a parallel to Hampl&rsquo;s book).</p>\n<p>We see here a woman who is smart, quick and in control of her faculties wanting to fight and having to accept, that there is no real shortcut, no swift way to skip the all too human need to just feel shitty for a while, to be scared, to be upset, to not know, to maybe not even understand why your own seemingly better argument, the pointed question or educated guess doesn&rsquo;t cut it. To be clear, what Didion focusses on is not this desire to skip the lowly emotions and loss of control that are part of the human condition. But, to me, she exemplifies how hard it is to accept the necessity of being a passenger, not the driver, for a while after an event like this.</p>\n<p>One strength of Didion&rsquo;s writing is that she can put a finger on the power of slightly changed emphases. Like in her text &ldquo;Everywoman.com&rdquo; about Martha Stewart and her empire from the second book of her&rsquo;s I have listened to: Let Me Tell You What I Mean, a collection of essays from 1968 to 2000.</p>\n<p>In Everywoman.com she turns the critique on Martha Stewart, a home maker turned CEO of a billion dollar company, inside out. The critique goes something like this: Martha Stewart is a fraud, because she pretends to be a simple homemaker, like her fans, even though in reality she is a driven business woman who created merely an artifice of being a homemaker. Didion is directing her more empathetic read of Stewart mainly against Jerry Oppenheimer&rsquo;s unauthorized investigative Book on her: Just Desserts. Opposed to Oppenheimer, Didion concludes that Stewart&rsquo;s success, Artifice and all, are inspirational to US-American women because Stewart managed to create her own rags to riches story: from homemaker to CEO.</p>\n<p>One thing I picked up and that is eerily related to her empathy for Stewart is her own success.

Probably.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Didion is well off, that much is clear. She has been a successful writer for a long time and coming up in a much more socially mobile era, she ended up being wealthy. The question is: Does this take away from her writing? And the answer is: Yes, a little bit. I wouldn&rsquo;t go so far to suggest that I can&rsquo;t relate or that what she has to say is not interesting, quiet the opposite, but because Didion&rsquo;s voice is one of careful reexamination (it reminds of the idiom &ldquo;show me, I&rsquo;m from Missouri&rdquo;) and her reputation is one of popularizing counter culture, of problematizing the American Dream I can&rsquo;t deny that the success, although earned, subverts a little bit her persona, her self-conception or the frame from which I read her (so maybe, probably, this is on me). It complicates the relationship between me, the reader (or listener in my case), and her, the counter culture writer. Now, I am not owed an uncomplicated relationship. But I do have to admit that the contrast of a now wealthy writer that came from a place of socially conscious reporting - and still has those instincts but lives a totally different life - lead to some cognitive dissonance. It totally makes sense that lives like this exist. She is not the first, nor the last that will have had also monetary success from writing empathetically about various social issues.

For a while I assumed it was weakness to be interested in this somewhat incomplete form - is that even the right word? - that is, autobiographical writing.

And so nothing is ever just the cause of anything or arranges itself neatly into a narrative ark.

				"content_html": "<p>When I was looking through my DayOne posts - the recent acquisition of the journaling app by automattic made me curious; I had not been using the app in a couple of years - I stumbled upon a journal entry that included a few screenshots of tweets that a quite popular German political Twitterer (maybe 30k followers back then, now around 50k followers) had posted, that berated me fiercely. How stupid I was and how dare I speak up against this person. They called me a baboon that needed to be put into place amongst other things. I think they called me sexist, too. I didn&rsquo;t have the heart to plunge deeper into the post. As I was simply too shocked. I had completely forgotten about this life altering experience half a decade ago. But here it was. And the remembering began.</p>\n<p>What had happened? When I was studying history of science and technology I was not shy to speak up. I was a young man that deemed himself smart and with a talent for research. I also had way too much time on my hands, which made me &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; in class. I read and studied furiously. And what I learned I wanted to apply. That is, nothing went past me in class. Any little uncertainty that came up, I problematized - to the frustration of my professors, I&rsquo;m sure, as well as my classmates. I wanted to be a researcher, or no, I wanted to be a prodigy. A person with great potential to become an exceptional researcher. I dreamt big. And I wanted my professors to see how smart I was. I had this dream that somebody would take me under their wing, make me behave, by offering a path to a career in research. I wanted to be tamed, I think, so that I could become the beautiful, creative researcher that I thought I ought to be.</p>\n<p>In any case, this phase of my life was a messy one and so were the discussions in the seminars. Lots of arguments, lots and lots of monologuing on my part. Oh, my poor classmates, forgive me! But that&rsquo;s who I was back then and although I look back with shame, I would be lying if I would not point out that this time of my life was one of the most instructive phases of it as well.</p>\n<p>I remember neither subject of the course nor the specific book introduction, chapter or article that we were assigned to read for this weeks class. What I do remember is that I disagreed vehemently with the author&rsquo;s premise that nobody had as of yet <em>really</em> looked into the topic at hand, except herself. That the author was female was incidental to my disagreement. But I never liked this take. To me, history was all about uncovering more and more aspects of the past. And a new take was adding a new shade, a new layer to the beautiful complexities of historiography as it related to the topic at hand. There is no singular fundamental take on history that subsumes all other takes - or at least not for long. History is best, I thought, if it was a humbling exercise, one in which your own strong opinions and values get somewhat relativized. History, to me, was a quest for authenticity, for serious inquiry, that ought not to bend to the political fashions of the day - even if I happen to agree with them. History ought to be historicist, in the German sense, where the understanding of a happening stems from a process of trying to find plausibility in the actions through sympathy for the actors - no matter how vile their behavior would be deemed, probably rightfully so, in our time. In short I was a young man looking for authenticity in a world full of ironic takes. I craved sincerity. &ldquo;Be real with me&rdquo;, I thought often, &ldquo;I want to like you&rdquo;. &ldquo;I want to be sure that you like me&rdquo;, if you say so, too. I was lonely and longed for reliability.</p>\n<p>It was well known amongst history of science students back then, that we had a minor celebrity in our midst. This person was a young politician of some clout. An up-and-comer that had gotten a taste of political authority, of respect towards their own person, after being elected to the city&rsquo;s parliament. They were invited to talk shows and interviewed a few times for TV and radio back then. They carried the aura of demanding respect into our classroom as well. Wearing nice long woolen coats, good fitting suits and expensive looking scarfs, not at all what the rest of us normals wore and especially not me, the wild man in the shabby cloths. They were standing out. They had understood that clothes make the person. At the same time their public persona was one of irony, of trolling for the greater good, or what they perceived as the greater good. They were a postmodern politician. One that always seemed to play both sides of the un/certainty coin: Claiming &ldquo;Facts first!&rdquo; but being crowned troll of the year some years earlier.</p>\n<p>The actual quarrel around which I have been circulating for this handful of paragraphs is explained quickly: My adversary had read the text different than me - or not differently, but more affirmatively. The claim of a fundamental take did not repel them, quite the opposite. They bought the author&rsquo;s points about what others had overlooked, maybe they bought the idea of a perfect all-encompassing historical take as well? I wasn&rsquo;t sure back then, but I was sure that history doesn&rsquo;t bend to a totalitarian approach. Writing history is a process of picking and choosing, of simplification. So I argued against their notion, vehemently. That the author had a feminist viewpoint - which was so incidental to my points - became the linchpin of the discussion. To this day I am sure of this: Even a struggle so central to modern societal progress as equality can only ever be an aspect of historiography. You may base a whole career on feminist history - and that would be an important pursuit - but nobody would claim everything is said and done when we have told all there is to tell about this struggle. No. No! And again: No!</p>\n<p>I would like to claim that I stayed as calm as I am now, writing all this down however many years later, but that would be a lie. We shouted at each other. I didn&rsquo;t permit this person, or my professor for that matter, to have the last word. I was incapable to give in, to allow this person to lug his intimidating aura around to steamroll me. After all, this was academia! Or its impoverished simulacrum at least. And arguments ought to count more than any accomplishments in other arenas of society here. Finally, the person just left in the middle of the class, infuriated, slamming the door. I was about to make another remark about their bad attitude, but was silenced by my professor: &ldquo;Martin!&rdquo; He only shouted this one word. My name. &ldquo;Martin!&rdquo; &ldquo;There it was&rdquo;, I thought. Finally an acknowledgement. I felt oddly good. I felt put into place. And wasn&rsquo;t this what I wanted? To be put into place?</p>\n<p>A few hours later, still pumped up from the altercation, I learned that my opponent had posted the tweets they did. I don&rsquo;t think they assumed that I was a Twitter user or would seek ought their timeline - if they cared at all. I found myself in an exceptional situation: I could read what another person that didn&rsquo;t like me thought about me. They just had put it out there for anyone to read. That included me and their kinda big audience. Some people liked those tweets, others retweeted them. And even though I knew, intellectually, that these tweets weren&rsquo;t meant for me or were in the end about me, really (they were about this persons anger), I felt deeply hurt. I felt seen, in a bad way. I felt revealed, caught. I felt like I was laughable. The whole village, <em>their</em> village, had it out for me, pointing, be it in anger or amusement about this anti-feminist idiot, who came to town, unbidden, to insult the mayor with his retrograde ideas, the fool, not even able to see how antiprogressive he is. I felt my artifice was visible as such. The political ascriptions didn&rsquo;t bother me, because they weren&rsquo;t accurate. But the persona that was described between the lines did. This mess of piled up insecurities that held up the disguise of an eager student was laid bare. There I was, in my most unfavorable interpretation. However, I couldn&rsquo;t deny the fact that it was a possible interpretation. It had a connection to reality. Yes, I was a self-serious jerk. And I knew it, I realized it, sometimes. And in this moment, I could see it clearly, I wasn&rsquo;t the only one who was aware. I felt deeply ashamed.</p>\n<p>As though a pill as it is swallow to remember all of this, to rethink all of this: I am grateful that I had the strength back then to screenshot those tweets and put them into my journal. I don&rsquo;t know if I knew it back then, but I preserved a seminal moment in my life. There is no real moral here. And I couldn&rsquo;t point to this vignette as the cause for things being different from there on out. I carried on a couple of years longer with this prodigy-jerk persona, before it finally clicked that this wasn&rsquo;t the way. Erosion takes its time. But I will always think back to this moment in my life when thinking about where the beginning of the end of that persona is located. It&rsquo;s right then and there. I am a better person for it today, prodigy or not.</p>\n",

This person was a young politician of some clout. An up-and-comer that had gotten a taste of political authority, of respect towards their own person, after being elected to the city's parliament. They were invited to talk shows and interviewed a few times for TV and radio back then. They carried the aura of demanding respect into our classroom as well. Wearing nice long woolen coats, good fitting suits and expensive looking scarfs, not at all what the rest of us normals wore and especially not me, the wild man in the shabby cloths. They were standing out. They had understood that clothes make the person. At the same time their public persona was one of irony, of trolling for the greater good, or what they perceived as the greater good. They were a postmodern politician. One that always seemed to play both sides of the un/certainty coin: Claiming \"Facts first!\" but being crowned troll of the year some years earlier.\n\nThe actual quarrel around which I have been circulating for this handful of paragraphs is explained quickly: My adversary had read the text different than me - or not differently, but more affirmatively. The claim of a fundamental take did not repel them, quite the opposite. They bought the author's points about what others had overlooked, maybe they bought the idea of a perfect all-encompassing historical take as well? I wasn't sure back then, but I was sure that history doesn't bend to a totalitarian approach. Writing history is a process of picking and choosing, of simplification. So I argued against their notion, vehemently. That the author had a feminist viewpoint - which was so incidental to my points - became the linchpin of the discussion. To this day I am sure of this: Even a struggle so central to modern societal progress as equality can only ever be an aspect of historiography. You may base a whole career on feminist history - and that would be an important pursuit - but nobody would claim everything is said and done when we have told all there is to tell about this struggle. No. No! And again: No!\n\nI would like to claim that I stayed as calm as I am now, writing all this down however many years later, but that would be a lie. We shouted at each other. I didn't permit this person, or my professor for that matter, to have the last word. I was incapable to give in, to allow this person to lug his intimidating aura around to steamroll me. After all, this was academia! Or its impoverished simulacrum at least. And arguments ought to count more than any accomplishments in other arenas of society here. Finally, the person just left in the middle of the class, infuriated, slamming the door. I was about to make another remark about their bad attitude, but was silenced by my professor: \"Martin!\" He only shouted this one word. My name. \"Martin!\" \"There it was\", I thought. Finally an acknowledgement. I felt oddly good. I felt put into place. And wasn't this what I wanted? To be put into place?\n\nA few hours later, still pumped up from the altercation, I learned that my opponent had posted the tweets they did. I don't think they assumed that I was a Twitter user or would seek ought their timeline - if they cared at all. I found myself in an exceptional situation: I could read what another person that didn't like me thought about me. They just had put it out there for anyone to read. That included me and their kinda big audience. Some people liked those tweets, others retweeted them. And even though I knew, intellectually, that these tweets weren't meant for me or were in the end about me, really (they were about this persons anger), I felt deeply hurt. I felt seen, in a bad way. I felt revealed, caught. I felt like I was laughable. The whole village, *their* village, had it out for me, pointing, be it in anger or amusement about this anti-feminist idiot, who came to town, unbidden, to insult the mayor with his retrograde ideas, the fool, not even able to see how antiprogressive he is. I felt my artifice was visible as such. The political ascriptions didn't bother me, because they weren't accurate. But the persona that was described between the lines did. This mess of piled up insecurities that held up the disguise of an eager student was laid bare. There I was, in my most unfavorable interpretation. However, I couldn't deny the fact that it was a possible interpretation. It had a connection to reality. Yes, I was a self-serious jerk. And I knew it, I realized it, sometimes. And in this moment, I could see it clearly, I wasn't the only one who was aware. I felt deeply ashamed.\n\nAs though a pill as it is swallow to remember all of this, to rethink all of this: I am grateful that I had the strength back then to screenshot those tweets and put them into my journal. I don't know if I knew it back then, but I preserved a seminal moment in my life. There is no real moral here. And I couldn't point to this vignette as the cause for things being different from there on out. I carried on a couple of years longer with this prodigy-jerk persona, before it finally clicked that this wasn't the way. Erosion takes its time. But I will always think back to this moment in my life when thinking about where the beginning of the end of that persona is located. It's right then and there. I am a better person for it today, prodigy or not.\n",
