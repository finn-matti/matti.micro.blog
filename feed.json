				"title": "IDE Troubles: PHPStorm and VS Code",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I work as a programmer for my day job. Right now I am working on two php projects. Coming from <a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com\">Sublime Text</a> but having had the need for more IDE features I came to love <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com\">Visual Studio Code</a> and made it my home. VS Code is a great editor for PHP development, especially if you use the <a href=\"https://intelephense.com\">Intelephense</a> extension. However, the bigger the project, the more it becomes apparent, that the performance of the language server is not <em>that</em> great.</p>\n<p>I lived with this for many months now. Yesterday I started working on a new issue and thought to myself: “All of my dev team members use <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/\">Jetbrains PHPStorm</a>, I should give it a try.”. I had used <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/\">Jetbrains Intelij Idea</a> for a brief moment a while back and only remembered being fairly unimpressed, but not exactly why I felt that way. Having now tried getting into their PHP IDE product, I have to say my impression has not really changed and now I also remember why.</p>\n<p>Although the code intelligence performance is clearly better, it is the small stuff that gets me. The impetus for this post for example was that you can’t use standard shell shortcuts with the integrated terminal: <code>Control + R</code> (backwards history search) being one of my most often used commands.</p>\n<p>I appreciated that they offer a keymap for people coming from Code to PHPStorm and as far as I can tell, the commands in it work. But customizing an IDE is more than just having the same default shortcuts for common tasks available in the new app. I have a bunch of my own shortcuts in code that use the pattern <code>CMD + H &lt;Key&gt;</code> (press <code>CMD + H</code> and then <code>&lt;Key&gt;</code>). I use <code>CMD + H</code>, because my last name start with H, so it was (and is) easier to remember. It just so happens that <code>CMD + H</code> is also a system wide shortcut for hiding an application. So when I tried to set up a frequently used shortcut to reveal the currently opened file in the sidebar navigation, <code>CMD + H S</code> the PHPStorm app was just hidden. In other words it did not “shadow” or override system shortcuts when asked. This feels even more arbitrary if we take those two things together: On the one hand standard shortcuts of the shell running inside the integrated terminal are shadowed per default - and this can also not be disabled -  and on the other hand wanting to shadow a system wide shortcut like <code>CMD + H</code> is not possible without remapping the shortcut within the OS. I feel like the IDE is not really playing along, but instead makes me jump through hoops.</p>\n<p>These are only two compounding cuts of a thousand that make PHPStorm hard to love in my opinion. I have an especially hard time understanding the design decisions to remove long standing functionality from a shell by shadowing standard shortcuts. It’s just a bad idea. It does explain why my colleagues never use the integrated terminal, but have an extra shell window open to the side, to run terminal commands.</p>\n<p>All in all I am very unimpressed by PHPStorm, but also worried: If the performance of Intelephense stays as bad much longer, I might have to look at other options. I know that Netbeans and Eclipse also have PHP features, I just don’t know anyone using, let alone loving these apps for PHP development…</p>\n",

My thoughts after the keynote:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I couldn’t be more excited about the new iPadOS features</li>\n<li>I am slightly sad that the two new MacBook models - the new M2 MacBook Air and the new 13-inch MacBook Pro - would have been options for my needs and budget</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since the iPad Pro was supposed to be my main machine - not least because I wanted to see if that is possible and fun - I’m even more excited to double down on that. Yeah, I just bought the older MacBook Air, but I bought it because I assume that the light coding I’m doing in my free time and the heavier reading/writing/note taking/processing workflow I have, will lead me to use a machine that can run a less walled in OS with multitasking capabilities. We’ll see.</p>\n<p>I wonder if I would have picked a beefier M2 Air over my two machine solution, but I’m also happy I got both devices. We live in a time of exciting technology in which we can pick the right digital tool for the job at hand and I’m happy that I can experience this exciting future.</p>\n<p>In any case: My new hardware - I’m still waiting on my new Air - is/is going to be an amazing upgrade to my technological status quo. My personal laptop has been a 13-inch Mac Pro from 2013. And although that computer is still working (I just upgraded it to Monterey this morning!), it was time to upgrade. I’m really looking forward to leaving the sluggish, syrupy Mac experience behind.</p>\n",

It is an event that can interact with me and potentially makes me do things. It’s a trigger (or cue).</p>\n<p>Notifications can be desirable, overwhelming, unhelpful or outright spam. They are not inherently good or bad, but they are not a neutral thing in the world either: They make a difference.</p>\n<p>Judging the usefulness of a notification is a involved process. The complexity of getting notifications right increases when realizing that you have to set them up beforehand, which means you have to expect the future.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1.whatdoyounotwanttomiss-notwantingtomisssomethingdoesn’tmeanyouneedtoknowaboutitimmediately.\">1. What do you not want to miss? - Not wanting to miss something doesn’t mean you need to know about it immediately.</h3>\n<p>Missing something means that a change of state in my world passed me by. Notification, on or not: If I missed it, the knowledge of having missed it implies that I now know that my world has changed (it) and I noticed afterwards. For things I don’t want to miss, I am interested in the changed state of affairs. But this doesn’t mean that I need to know about it now.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2.isthechangeofstateinitselfimportant-achangeofthestatusquodoesn’tnecessarilymeantheinfoisgoingtoberelevantforeverorrelevanttemporarily.\">2. Is the change of state in itself important? - A change of the status quo doesn’t necessarily mean the info is going to be relevant forever (or relevant temporarily).</h3>\n<p>As compared to the things I don’t want to miss, here I’m more interested in the change of state: Something became available. A window of obligation/opportunity opened (or is about to close). Something was like <em>this</em> now it’s like <em>that</em>. Depending on the change, I might be interested in it forever or only for a limited period. In either case, time sensitivity itself is not the same as a change of state. It’s another property that alters this one.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3.howtimesensitiveisit-timesensitivityisnotthesameastheimportanceofthechangeoccurringortheimportanceofthenewstatusquo.\">3. How time sensitive is it? - Time sensitivity is not the same as the importance of the change occurring or the importance of the new status quo.</h3>\n<p>Time sensitivity doesn’t mean any change of state needs to be known now. Sometimes it needs to be known depending on a location or on a certain date and time. “Now” is one, but not the only possibility. The reasons for a notification being time sensitive can be manifold in practice. Abstractly speaking, it is a question of priority and urgency - which are also not the same thing.</p>\n<p>Whilst priority is trying to rank items by importance (which itself is a relative measure of impactfulness of the thing in question) to my world, urgency re-ranks those items according to currently open windows of opportunity and/or obligation.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Not only is it hard to keep all these distinctions in mind when I’m trying to predict my future, I’m also prone to getting it wrong, because my world is not made of numbers. Parts of my world aren’t measurable, some parts are not even comparable. Still other parts might not even be identifiable as parts!</p>\n<p>And if this wasn’t making it difficult enough, this is surely not even close to a complete description of the problem space and none of this is available to me objectively, either. So what to do?</p>\n<h2 id=\"keepingitsimple\">Keeping It Simple</h2>\n<h3 id=\"understandthenotificationsystemofyoursetup\">Understand the notification system of your setup</h3>\n<p>I’m an Apple user and have an iPhone, a work Mac, a personal Mac and an iPad. For me, it was important to understand that while focus modes can be shared across devices, the per-app notification settings are not.</p>\n<p>Which makes sense, since not every app is available, let alone installed on every device.</p>\n<p>Some notification specific settings are adjusted within the app itself, while others are adjusted through the settings of the os.</p>\n<h3 id=\"startwithnonotificationsbadgesanything\">Start with no notifications, badges, anything</h3>\n<p>By disabling all notifications (individually), I am making sure that noise doesn’t even reach me. The default answer to any new app asking for permission to push notifications to me is “No”.</p>\n<p>Same goes for badges, space on my home screen, or an app even getting installed. By radically reducing the apps that I have to manage, I reduce the problem a lot, by following this principled approach.</p>\n<h3 id=\"trytheleastdistractingsimplethingfirst\">Try the least distracting, simple thing first</h3>\n<p>I knew some apps needed some way to inform me. And although my analysis above was important to get a feel for the difficulty of the problem, an 80% solution for 20% of effort may be good enough in practice. So I try that first for any app that actually really needs to inform me.</p>\n<p>The harder part of this heuristic is figuring out what the least distracting thing is. I find a badge count of the right measure to be pretty good. But sometimes, actual notifications on one or more devices might be the obvious choice.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ifidon’tactonitiremoveit\">If I don’t act on it, I remove it</h3>\n<p>If something is only noise to me, it’s not worth getting informed about.

This is hard to measure. A good quick test is maybe if notification center is a useful place to me, or not.

But I think that this project has run its course: I don‘t feel the need to publish this every week anymore. It‘s not like nothing changes or that there is nothing to report dog-wise, but it all comes down to the need to simplify and de-schedule my life. And I have episodes for the first six months, which seems like a good place to stop.</p>\n\n<p>Seasons change. And this is how I feel about my microcasting: Right now I‘d much rather write than talk. Looking at my blog I mostly see noise that was produced hastily to satisfy a self-imposed schedule. I will let this stuff go, for now.</p>\n",

But the absence just made it more obvious, clear, that we - the beings and things in contrast to that absence - are indeed all there is.\n\nMeditation is often way more banal than this. Often it's just a reminder of my ability to show up and do something that stays vague as regards to its meaning, benefit to my observational skills, positive or negative impact on me and my suroundings - many unexpected challenges in life have this quality. Its opaque paradoxical nature is fascinating and I think this is why I continue to do it.\n",

				"content_text": "<p><a href=\"https://obsidian.md\">Obsidian</a> is a personal knowledge base and note taking app with a lot of flexibility and extensions that make it very powerful. If you like to <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/01/23/notes-on-notes.html\">take notes</a> and be in control of your data, then Obsidian might be the right fit.</p>\n<p>What makes Obsidian so valuable for me is that it allows me to consolidate a lot of things into one app. Like information about a project and its tasks. Reference materials about sociology and solutions to programming problems. Everything can be made to fit into Obsidian and thanks to its extensibility and configurability, the app can be adapted to my evolving needs over time.</p>\n<p>Most people point out that Obsidian is an app for people who like to <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/01/23/103518.html\">link their notes together</a>. If you rename a note in Obsidian, all the links to it will be renamed, too. Linking notes, so that they become chains and/or trees of notes unlocks emergent qualities that you wouldn’t be able to access without linking them.<a id=\"fnref:1\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"see footnote\" href=\"#fn:1\">[1]</a> It is also available as an iPhone app, that can do almost all the things that the Mac app can do. So you can take all your stuff with you as well.</p>\n<p>Obsidian might not be for you, because it might just be a little bit too much. But it might also just be the tool you were looking for. If you happen to have a tendency to react skeptically to overly hyped apps like this one: Ignore the knowledge graph visualization stuff<a id=\"fnref:2\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"see footnote\" href=\"#fn:2\">[2]</a> and also the personal knowledge base singularity talk and just try it out. Obsidian is great. Don’t let the sometimes overly boastful rhetoric in this space keep you from at least trying it.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\"><hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>For example: You will find notes that, taken together, inspire a new creative thought. You might also rediscover an old solution to a problem you currently have. Or you might notice a pattern in otherwise disparate information. <a class=\"reversefootnote\" title=\"return to article\" href=\"#fnref:1\"> ↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\">\n<p>I think that visualizing one’s notes <em>could</em> at some point be helpful for maintaining and refactoring, but we are not there, yet. <a class=\"reversefootnote\" title=\"return to article\" href=\"#fnref:2\"> ↩</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

I have not read a paper book since I have started using Readwise, though.</li>\n<li>PDFs: Readwise Web App - This is one of those someday/maybe list items. It&rsquo;s possible in theory to import highlights from PDFs via uploading those files and it is something I would like to have done, but not something I want to do. Most of my studying time I annotated PDFs digitally and most of those PDFs are still living in my Zotero-library.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Why even have a setup like this? Because Readwise is actually awesome. I was skeptical at first, but after reviewing highlights for about two weeks now, I can honestly say: The added engagement with my previously read stuff helps to keep me reading.<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>The real kicker is something else, though: Readwise offers an official <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/02/27/good-apps-obsidian.html\">Obsidian</a> - the note taking software - <a href=\"https://github.com/readwiseio/obsidian-readwise\">plugin</a> that syncs my highlights to my own markdown file based knowledge base.

				"content_text": "Currently my highlighting and annotation setup looks like this:\n\n![](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/uploads/2022/906ec19bd9.png)\n\n- Ebooks: Kindle - Even though Amazon as a company is not without its problems, their ebook reader just works and highlighting and annotating for ebooks works with Readwise flawlessly and without friction.[^1]\n- RSS and misc. articles: [Reeder](Reeder) and [Instapaper Premium](https://www.instapaper.com/premium) - I recently tried out [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com) and [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com), but the most versatile \"read an article on the web and annotate it\" setup is this: Send articles from your feed reader (and anywhere else) to Instapaper and annotate them there.[^2]\n- Podcasts: [Airr](https://www.airr.io) - I don't think, that I will ever switch my main podcatcher from Overcast to Airr, but if I have the need to capture a part of a podcast, I can open the episode I would like to annotate and create a note that is available in Readwise through this app.\n- Paper books: Readwise iOS app - I'll have to wait and see how much of a hassle this will end up being, but in theory I could capture highlights from paper books through the iOS app. I would need to take a photo of a page and after text recognition I can highlight what I would like to keep. I have not read a paper book since I have started using Readwise, though.\n- PDFs: Readwise Web App - This is one of those someday/maybe list items. It's possible in theory to import highlights from PDFs via uploading those files and it is something I would like to have done, but not something I want to do. Most of my studying time I annotated PDFs digitally and most of those PDFs are still living in my Zotero-library.\n\nWhy even have a setup like this? Because Readwise is actually awesome. I was skeptical at first, but after reviewing highlights for about two weeks now, I can honestly say: The added engagement with my previously read stuff helps to keep me reading.[^3]\n\nThe real kicker is something else, though: Readwise offers an official [Obsidian](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/02/27/good-apps-obsidian.html) - the note taking software - [plugin](https://github.com/readwiseio/obsidian-readwise) that syncs my highlights to my own markdown file based knowledge base. So even if I decide to stop using Readwise, the highlights and notes will still be there, in an open and somewhat future-proof format.\n\n[^1]: And I own the 6th generation Kindle Paperwhite (from 2014) already. Throwing it away doesn't seem to be smart. As long as it works, this works. … While writing this I looked into e-reader alternatives, but it seems that the Kindle is  the most convenient choice for a consumer with my needs.\n[^2]: Instapaper Premium is needed for the annotations (since you only get 5 per month on the free tier). Premium includes some other features like text-to-speech and speed reading, but I don't really use these features.\n[^3]: And writing.

				"content_text": "<p>In January I did a yearly Review and planning session, a thing I always try to do every year.</p>\n\n<p>This year I have the following goals and ideas which I'd like to try out:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Becoming an early riser - Status Quo: Big success! So much more time<sup><a href=\"#fn1-22434\" id=\"fnr1-22434\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> to do my projects. Se also my unter two minutes podcast <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/categories/the-early-riser/\">\"The Early Riser\"</a> that I record every single morning right after I have woken up.</li>\n<li>\"I will start\" - Explanation: Be the one who initiates communication, anticipate things to do before anybody has to bring them up - Status: Eh. Could be better, but I am not so bothered by this.</li>\n<li>Evidence-based living - Explanation: <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/01/19/080216.html\">Track things</a> and find metrics to make more informed decisions about different areas in my life.</li>\n<li>\"Commit\" - Explanation: Inspired by <a href=\"https://www.oliverburkeman.com/books\">4000 Weeks</a>, I'll try to commit to only three work-in-progress items at a time and if I'm committed try to bring those things to an end that is satisfactory while also resisting other demands - internally or externally - on me and my time and attention. Status: Okay, actually.</li>\n<li>\"Read and Write more\" - Status: Meh. I am trying, though. I found that playing around with <a href=\"https://readwise.io\">Readwise</a><sup><a href=\"#fn2-22434\" id=\"fnr2-22434\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> has motivated me to do more in this regard.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-22434\">\n<p>A day has only 24 Hours, so how is changing the start of the day making a difference? It's all about not snoozing and using time in bed effectively. If you need 10 hours in bed to get 6 hours of sleep that's not very effective. On the other hand: If you sleep 7 hours while laying in bed for 8 that's pretty good. Changing my sleep schedule made me a more effective sleeper. <a href=\"#fnr1-22434\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn2-22434\">\n<p>I can't decide if it's a great thing or overpriced, yet. [EDIT: <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/02/13/my-current-highlighting.html\">I have decided that I like it.

Taken together these two features mean, that you won&rsquo;t mark reminders completed that aren&rsquo;t really completed and you won&rsquo;t ignore the nudge that an overdue reminder gives you.

It&rsquo;s great for repeating tasks that need to be done on a specific time but don&rsquo;t have a clear duration (feeding the dog at specific times a day, for example). It&rsquo;s great for one-offs as well, where you want to or need to do something later but might forget about it.

Plugin-Themes now behave much more convenient: Just install the theme, activate for your blog, create a custom theme and only add <code>config/_default/markup.json</code> template.</p>\n<p><del>First of all make sure you are on the Hugo version 0.91 (dropdown in the Design screen, remember to save) and install the default theme as a plugin (Plug-ins screen). Then go to Design again and click on &ldquo;Edit Custom Themes&rdquo;, on the next screen click on the default theme and duplicate it with the button in the next screen. You should now be back in the custom themes overview list. Click Design in the sidebar once more and choose your custom theme, save.

				"content_text": "If you are one of [the brave people](https://www.manton.org/2022/01/07/moving-to-new.html) that uses Hugo Version 0.91 and wants to take advantage of Hugo's [native syntax highlighting](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/) capabilities on a light theme (like the default theme in this example), you might be surprised:\n\n![](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/uploads/2022/f32609ded9.png)\n\nAs you can see… you can't really see much.\n\nThankfully this can be changed, by changing the configuration for syntax highlighting. But in order to do that you have to know the following:\n\n<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" data-title=\"\" data-author=\"Jason Cardwell\" data-avatar=\"https://micro.blog/Moondeer/avatar.jpg\" cite=\"https://micro.blog/Moondeer/12348161\"><p><a href=\"https://micro.blog/matti\">[@matti](https://micro.blog/matti)</a> interesting … so much is still a blackbox for me. I just tinker until I get results. My two favorite finds are the config directory (which take precedent ahead of the json files) and the assets directory (with which you can build Javascript and Sass files from templates).</p>\n<footer>Jason Cardwell <cite><a href=\"https://micro.blog/Moondeer/12348161\">https://micro.blog/Moondeer/12348161</a></cite></footer></blockquote><script src=\"https://micro.blog/quoteback.js\"></script>\n\nYou have to know about the precedence because for some reason, changing the config.json in your theme won't do the trick. This is how it works:\n\n## Get A Functioning Custom \"New-Plugin-Style\"-Default-Theme For Your Blog\n\nEDIT 18.02.2022: The following is not up to date anymore. Plugin-Themes now behave much more convenient: Just install the theme, activate for your blog, create a custom theme and only add `config/_default/markup.json` template.\n\n~~First of all make sure you are on the Hugo version 0.91 (dropdown in the Design screen, remember to save) and install the default theme as a plugin (Plug-ins screen). Then go to Design again and click on \"Edit Custom Themes\", on the next screen click on the default theme and duplicate it with the button in the next screen. You should now be back in the custom themes overview list. Click Design in the sidebar once more and choose your custom theme, save. Click \"Edit Custom Themes\" again and then on your copy of the Default theme.[^1]~~\n\n\n## Change Configuration\n\nYou should now be inside your custom theme screen. Click on \"New Template\". You will be presented wie the template editor and theme preview split view.\n\nName the template `config/_default/markup.json` and set its contents to:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"highlight\": {\n      \"anchorLineNos\": false,\n      \"codeFences\": true,\n      \"guessSyntax\": false,\n      \"hl_Lines\": \"\",\n      \"lineAnchors\": \"\",\n      \"lineNoStart\": 1,\n      \"lineNos\": true,\n      \"lineNumbersInTable\": true,\n      \"noClasses\": true,\n      \"style\": \"monokailight\",\n      \"tabWidth\": 4\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nThis is basically the [default config from the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration-markup#highlight), except that for style we use `monokailight` instead of `monokay`. Click \"Update Template\", your site should be rebuilding as indicated by the spinner. When Hugo is done, syntax highlighting should now be working as intended and the code be legible.\n\nExample:\n\n```go-html-template\n{{ define \"main\" }}\n<div class=\"home h-feed\">\n  <ul class=\"post-list\">\n  {{ $paginator := .Paginate (where (where .Site.RegularPages.ByDate.Reverse \"Type\" \"post\") \"Params.title\" \"!=\" nil   ) (index .Site.Params \"archive-paginate\" | default 25) }}\n  {{ range $paginator.Pages  }}\n      <li class=\"h-entry\">\n\t\t\t<h1><a href=\"{{ .Permalink }}\">{{ .Title }}</a></h1>\n\n        <a href=\"{{ .Permalink }}\" class=\"u-url\"><span class=\"post-meta\"><time class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"{{ .Date.Format \"2006-01-02 15:04:05 -0700\" }}\">{{ .Date.Format \"Jan 2, 2006\" }}</time></span></a>\n\n        <div class=\"e-content\">\n         \t{{ .Content }}\n        </div>\n      </li>\n    {{ end }}\n  </ul>\n\n  <p class=\"rss-subscribe\">subscribe <a href=\"{{ \"feed.xml\" | absURL }}\">via RSS</a></p>\n\n</div>\n{{ end }}\n```\n\n\n~~[^1]: I'm not sure if this is all necessary or even the right way to go about it. It seems pretty involved and I don't even know how you would migrate your customizations in an easy way if you happen to have used the old style of choosing a theme… but this way works, that much I could prove.~~\n",

				"content_html": "<p>A difficult year. In better moments it was a so-so year. In other moments in which I take the bigger lines and shapes of my life into account it has been a bad year.</p>\n<p>There is a dog now in the family and that makes me happy.  We had a great summer vacation in northern Finnland. But this year was not without strain to keep moving in a positive direction or at least not lose ground. Like making it through fast flowing rapids. There was lots of stress: self-made and unavoidable at once. I broke my arm in the end of 2020 and needed to heal the first few months of 2021. Things at the job were hard and at times disappointing. Looking back, this year showed me the strength of my now six year long relationship; That we managed to get through this year together, trying to understand each other even more, giving each other space, when we knew there were lots of things going on. I am proud of us being able to talk, to forgive and to move on. Around midnight, when the neighbors were lighting fireworks, we acknowledged the year for what it was, especially for us two (the dogo was sleeping through the explosions…). Me being the more optimistic person even went as far as being hopeful for the new year. It carries the opportunity of a fresh start. We smiled and kissed.</p>\n<p>The pandemic didn&rsquo;t help. Being here in Finnland&rsquo;s north meant that we both experienced increasing cabin fever: a new topic was discovered. Do we need to move? How do we manage giving space and time to each other in a loving, non-condescending way? One fascinating aspect of being in a long-term relationship is how the relationship and with it oneself and the other changes over time. I wonder what captures this dynamic better: The continued reveal of yet another onion skin or a more evolutionary abstract image of ever-changing symbiotic organisms. It is the question between an essentialist and non-essentialist viewpoint. Whatever it is: Not knowing (or rather: deciding) makes this dynamic no less interesting to me.</p>\n<p>This year was hard and in many ways one I&rsquo;d like to forget. But I won&rsquo;t reduce the year to that. There were beautiful, funny, heartwarming, delightful moments. And these I won&rsquo;t forget.</p>\n<p>I am grateful for the past year&rsquo;s me trying to keep the ship afloat even when I wasn&rsquo;t feeling like it.</p>\n<p>I am grateful that I continued to be interested in cooking dinner for us. I feel like I have improved a little.</p>\n<p>I am grateful for the dog coming into our lives, our little chaos agent, that brought us so much happiness in a year of strain.</p>\n<p>I am grateful for my relationship and my partner being there and giving me the reality check that I sometimes needed.

				"content_text": "A difficult year. In better moments it was a so-so year. In other moments in which I take the bigger lines and shapes of my life into account it has been a bad year.\n\nThere is a dog now in the family and that makes me happy.  We had a great summer vacation in northern Finnland. But this year was not without strain to keep moving in a positive direction or at least not lose ground. Like making it through fast flowing rapids. There was lots of stress: self-made and unavoidable at once. I broke my arm in the end of 2020 and needed to heal the first few months of 2021. Things at the job were hard and at times disappointing. Looking back, this year showed me the strength of my now six year long relationship; That we managed to get through this year together, trying to understand each other even more, giving each other space, when we knew there were lots of things going on. I am proud of us being able to talk, to forgive and to move on. Around midnight, when the neighbors were lighting fireworks, we acknowledged the year for what it was, especially for us two (the dogo was sleeping through the explosions…). Me being the more optimistic person even went as far as being hopeful for the new year. It carries the opportunity of a fresh start. We smiled and kissed.\n\nThe pandemic didn't help. Being here in Finnland's north meant that we both experienced increasing cabin fever: a new topic was discovered. Do we need to move? How do we manage giving space and time to each other in a loving, non-condescending way? One fascinating aspect of being in a long-term relationship is how the relationship and with it oneself and the other changes over time. I wonder what captures this dynamic better: The continued reveal of yet another onion skin or a more evolutionary abstract image of ever-changing symbiotic organisms. It is the question between an essentialist and non-essentialist viewpoint. Whatever it is: Not knowing (or rather: deciding) makes this dynamic no less interesting to me.\n\nThis year was hard and in many ways one I'd like to forget. But I won't reduce the year to that. There were beautiful, funny, heartwarming, delightful moments. And these I won't forget.\n\nI am grateful for the past year's me trying to keep the ship afloat even when I wasn't feeling like it.\n\nI am grateful that I continued to be interested in cooking dinner for us. I feel like I have improved a little.\n\nI am grateful for the dog coming into our lives, our little chaos agent, that brought us so much happiness in a year of strain.\n\nI am grateful for my relationship and my partner being there and giving me the reality check that I sometimes needed. Or the back rub. Or the space and time. Or the normality of everyday life. I love you for your honesty, humor, your smile and you holding me accountable. You, like no other can make me reconsider a strongly held belief. You, like no other can make me belief I could be a decent man if I tried. Thank you for being here with me, E.\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I barely can watch movies anymore. This has less to do with problems of changing aesthetics and me being unable to adapt (, although maybe a little bit). It’s more about it getting harder and harder to suspend my disbelief. An example from last night: I tried to watch „Don’t look up“ but got so infuriated by the depiction of how things would supposedly work, that I couldn’t enjoy an otherwise interesting idea. I guess I just don’t like when a movie’s plotting is dependent on unrealistic premises, especially when it claims to start from a place of (somewhat heightened) realism. Things should make sense within the confines of its world. If our actual world builds the backbone of the movie’s world then you gotta show the work that’s happening why things are different than we normally would expect them to be. Show me the work. This is not the same as asking for everything to be explained. I am simply asking for potential plausibility. Handwaving in the right spots is of course part of storytelling.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe it’s because I have studied history of science and technology, have been working in the literature studies department while I was studying and am now working as a programmer that I am therefore primed to notice and dislike such inconsistencies. I prefer nonfiction, memoirs and sociologically interesting sci-fi. Works that do not reduce the interesting complexities of our world to tell a story that doesn’t shy away from the effort to be plausible.</p>\n\n<p>I think that this happens to me more frequently now, is because I am much more time- and attention-constrained. I do not have the resources after a long day to consume too many things that ask me to do the work of „making it work“. I also have less chances to consume anything at all the older I get and the more responsibilities I have and am therefore more discerning on what I spend my time on. „Tried and true“ is often the answer. So no wonder that watching sports have become such a big part of my life instead of artistic works. I also prefer a solid but consistent tv show over an at times brilliant but otherwise disappointing one. I assess consuming media more and more from a standpoint of how risky it is: How likely will I be disappointed? I already have lists of lists of things I would like to do. If I decide to try something new, it better be worth it. And: It seldom is.</p>\n\n<p>There is a ratcheting effect built in this way of consuming media: You do more and more of the same and less and less of the new. If it was only me I would even prefer such a bias, but it also has consequences for enjoying things like movies and tv shows together with my partner. So I end up giving chances to things I would have not considered. Maybe that’s good. Things shouldn’t be too predictable either. But boy, do many, many things suffer from a lack of plausibility…</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I was going to answer to this ongoing conversation within the thread but ran out of space and I thought it is interesting enough to warrant a titled post<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>:</p>\n<p>Simon&rsquo;s observation is interesting to me because I think it relates to my point from the other day about <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2021/09/30/problems-of-the.html\">social problems being naturally occurring emergent properties of the social</a>.</p>\n<p>The question of why do <em>some</em> people feel entitled to demand everything to be available for free on the web is, I think, mostly answered by the attitudes they hold<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup>: Is it important to you (to acknowledge that you ought to pay for stuff and/or be fine with not having stuff), or not? And I think this is universal and holds actually true for physical stuff as well.</p>\n<p>Given suitable conditions, the same demands will pop up in the physical world. Example: My partner works in a national park. In the customer service center of this park, they offer printed maps of the area for free. In other parks the same kind of maps cost money. Some People are upset by this state of affairs.<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>If this behavioral pattern is not confined to the web, the question then becomes a question of how to change the attitudes of people - given, that we want to problematize this observation. Can we? And more importantly: at what cost? This question is interesting to me, because I think it relates to my point about social problems being emergent properties, that I mentioned earlier.</p>\n<p>Attitudes and values are not one and the same. Values are part of the social and individuals might have an affirming or rejecting attitude towards those values. The way to get to an individual is through the social - you&rsquo;ll have to be social to interact. This means that to change an individual&rsquo;s attitude (or more efficient: make attitudes matter less) is a social problem - and, again, as I said in that other post: social problems are more social realities than problems, so changing attitudes can only be achieved by suppression<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">4</a></sup>. Suppressing anything - even for a moment in history - takes lots of maintenance. To make it last, you have to establish structures within the social. So this social question becomes cultural - if you want to make it last.</p>\n<p>I will stop here and ask, if the amount of resources needed to do this is worth it. And I&rsquo;ll answer that it is not. Akin to locks keeping honest people honest, the real task is to get more people who are sitting on the fence (or peeking over it) on the &ldquo;right&rdquo; (&ldquo;our&rdquo;) side. As far as I can tell the best &ldquo;above board&rdquo; way to do this is to communicate clearly what is free and what is not and give people varied options to buy what needs to be bought.<sup id=\"fnref:5\"><a href=\"#fn:5\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">5</a></sup> Giving reasons why to buy can help. Letting your personality shine through also helps.</p>\n<p>In short: People behaving entitled and demanding things for free is not tied to the web only. These behaviors are the result of undesirable attitudes that are too hard and too expensive to change sustainably. Therefore the real task is - apart from understanding the initial problem better - not changing the attitudes but to offer the people which are close to doing the right thing options to follow through and not worry about the rest.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>I want to thank Simon for giving me an opportunity to think out loud. This post took the above conversation as a starting point, but it is not an attempt to argue with Simon, show off, or troll. I just took our conversation and ran with it. So the &ldquo;you&rdquo; or the opposing voice in this post, does not refer to Simon. It does not presume that Simon hasn&rsquo;t thought about these things as well, etc. This post is meant as an exploration, not an agitation.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>This is mostly an argument of plausibility: I do not claim to know exactly what attitudes they hold, but I do claim that this line of thinking makes their behavior plausible, therefore possible, explainable, understandable.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:2\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:3\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>I will admit that I was a little upset, too: Because it was inconsistent and hard to anticipate what to expect. And I like to be able to anticipate what comes next. It&rsquo;s comforting, it makes me feel I&rsquo;m in control. This could be another plausible set of attitudes - as opposed to not believing that paying for stuff is important - of why people are behaving this way.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:3\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:4\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>I&rsquo;ll restate that suppression doesn&rsquo;t need to be a negative thing.

And I think this is universal and holds actually true for physical stuff as well.\n\nGiven suitable conditions, the same demands will pop up in the physical world. Example: My partner works in a national park. In the customer service center of this park, they offer printed maps of the area for free. In other parks the same kind of maps cost money. Some People are upset by this state of affairs.[^3]\n\nIf this behavioral pattern is not confined to the web, the question then becomes a question of how to change the attitudes of people - given, that we want to problematize this observation. Can we? And more importantly: at what cost? This question is interesting to me, because I think it relates to my point about social problems being emergent properties, that I mentioned earlier.\n\nAttitudes and values are not one and the same. Values are part of the social and individuals might have an affirming or rejecting attitude towards those values. The way to get to an individual is through the social - you'll have to be social to interact. This means that to change an individual's attitude (or more efficient: make attitudes matter less) is a social problem - and, again, as I said in that other post: social problems are more social realities than problems, so changing attitudes can only be achieved by suppression[^4]. Suppressing anything - even for a moment in history - takes lots of maintenance. To make it last, you have to establish structures within the social. So this social question becomes cultural - if you want to make it last.\n\nI will stop here and ask, if the amount of resources needed to do this is worth it. And I'll answer that it is not. Akin to locks keeping honest people honest, the real task is to get more people who are sitting on the fence (or peeking over it) on the \"right\" (\"our\") side. As far as I can tell the best \"above board\" way to do this is to communicate clearly what is free and what is not and give people varied options to buy what needs to be bought.[^5] Giving reasons why to buy can help. Letting your personality shine through also helps.\n\nIn short: People behaving entitled and demanding things for free is not tied to the web only. These behaviors are the result of undesirable attitudes that are too hard and too expensive to change sustainably. Therefore the real task is - apart from understanding the initial problem better - not changing the attitudes but to offer the people which are close to doing the right thing options to follow through and not worry about the rest.\n\n[^1]: I want to thank Simon for giving me an opportunity to think out loud. This post took the above conversation as a starting point, but it is not an attempt to argue with Simon, show off, or troll. I just took our conversation and ran with it. So the \"you\" or the opposing voice in this post, does not refer to Simon. It does not presume that Simon hasn't thought about these things as well, etc. This post is meant as an exploration, not an agitation.\n\n[^2]: This is mostly an argument of plausibility: I do not claim to know exactly what attitudes they hold, but I do claim that this line of thinking makes their behavior plausible, therefore possible, explainable, understandable.\n\n[^3]: I will admit that I was a little upset, too: Because it was inconsistent and hard to anticipate what to expect. And I like to be able to anticipate what comes next. It's comforting, it makes me feel I'm in control. This could be another plausible set of attitudes - as opposed to not believing that paying for stuff is important - of why people are behaving this way.\n\n[^4]: I'll restate that suppression doesn't need to be a negative thing. Think of it more like selective breeding.\n\n[^5]: I'm excluding dark patterns here, that exploit human nature to get the desired result. Instead of persuasion these patterns rely on seduction.\n",

Since they are properties, we're unlikely to fix them on a grander scale. You aren't so much \"fixing\" these problems, anyways: You suppress them (which isn't meant to suggest that that's always a bad thing). But suppression is work, takes infrastructure. The bigger the social structure you try to keep \"in order\" (like a gardener) the bigger the work. This is why suppression only works for self selected (or lucky), small groups with aligned interests and supporting structures (resources, established processes, a shared and actively maintained history<sup><a href=\"#fn2-8648\" id=\"fnr2-8648\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">2</a></sup>, …). Teams, clubs, activist and research groups, etc. have the best chances to successfully suppress some of the more nastier but nonetheless naturally occurring characteristics of the social.

				"content_html": "<p>This book is as much about aging than it is about her adopted daughter Quintana. It is a sad book. It is a book of acceptance, I think.</p>\n<p>I read this in one siting on the porch of my Girlfriends mom, living in Finnland, it was already a little too cold to sit there for the four hours or so it took me. But the book didn&rsquo;t let me go.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2021/07/24/acceptance-as-a.html\">my last review</a> of two of Didion&rsquo;s books I wrote that the author&rsquo;s smarts won&rsquo;t save her from the inevitability of life. In the end her body, her mind, will fail. In the end, what could she even have done to save her child? So she mourns, or tries to mourn, like a person not acquainted with these traditions. This outsider&rsquo;s view to a very human problem was very relatable: I find myself often fascinated but not affected personally by the emotional weather of day to day life. It&rsquo;s more the second order emotions - emotions about other people&rsquo;s reactions to things I believe to have already understood, filed away, moved on from - that get me. This is probably more common than I know I presume at times.</p>\n<p>It is very powerful to read about a person so gifted that she can&rsquo;t help it to struggle with the voice in which she writes. Was how she wrote before her memoirist turn ever anything more than something she used <em>instead</em> of her own voice? In short: <em>a</em> voice instead of <em>her</em> voice? That is probably not fair. Authenticity is not a boolean. It is a construct. A repeated question from the book: How can one be direct in one&rsquo;s writing? Although I listened to &ldquo;The Year Of Magical Thinking&rdquo; I think Blue Nights might be her most reflective book I have consumed, yet.</p>\n<p>Didion is not shy to discuss the many mental health issues, that her Daughter had to face. How the names for the diagnosis changed over time, but the problems essentially stayed the same. One such name: borderline personality disorder. Mental health is not what took her life, not directly at least, but a lost battle against infection. That Quintana was adopted plays a big part in the book and is one of the most powerful themes: Didion&rsquo;s reflection about the &lsquo;recommended choice narrative&rsquo; and Quintanas question &ldquo;What if you didn&rsquo;t choose me?&rdquo; is as relatable as it is gut-wrenching.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard to imagine what my impression of &ldquo;Blue Nights&rdquo; would have been without knowing &ldquo;The Year Of Magical Thinking&rdquo;. It is often the case with memoirist writing that its power stems from the layers - in volume as in sophistication and arrangement. And I feel like Didion&rsquo;s two memoirs, as sad as they might be, are amazingly rich and deep.</p>\n<p>In my last review I mentioned the problem of privilege in Didion&rsquo;s writing and this makes it harder at times to relate to her. In Blue Nights she makes an attempt to address this topic, when she asks whether Quintana had a privileged childhood or not. The answer comes down to &ldquo;I mean, we weren&rsquo;t <em>that</em> rich…&rdquo;. Maybe this would have needed a more elaborate treatment.</p>\n<p>I really liked this book and I am surprised how much I managed to write about it, or rather my thoughts about it, here. I like Didion as a memoirist, too. I am not so sure that I will ever check out her more literary works. I actually rarely do that after having consumed memoirs of writers or artists. No, it&rsquo;s the mundane and not so mundane everyday stuff - or rather its heightened, polished reflective version - that interests me.</p>\n<p>One last time back to the book: &ldquo;Blue Nights&rdquo; is a great book about mourning, about aging, about being a parent and a writer. Didion is steeped in a way of life that I would guess only exists in its fossilized forms, in memories. The relatable topics and the now lost to us extravagance of old Hollywood produce a rich, deep and at times paradoxical memoir that I would especially recommend if you can spare the time to consume &ldquo;The Year Of Magical Thinking&rdquo; beforehand.</p>\n",

This outsider's view to a very human problem was very relatable: I find myself often fascinated but not affected personally by the emotional weather of day to day life. It's more the second order emotions - emotions about other people's reactions to things I believe to have already understood, filed away, moved on from - that get me. This is probably more common than I know I presume at times.\n\nIt is very powerful to read about a person so gifted that she can't help it to struggle with the voice in which she writes. Was how she wrote before her memoirist turn ever anything more than something she used *instead* of her own voice? In short: *a* voice instead of *her* voice? That is probably not fair. Authenticity is not a boolean. It is a construct. A repeated question from the book: How can one be direct in one's writing? Although I listened to \"The Year Of Magical Thinking\" I think Blue Nights might be her most reflective book I have consumed, yet.\n\nDidion is not shy to discuss the many mental health issues, that her Daughter had to face. How the names for the diagnosis changed over time, but the problems essentially stayed the same. One such name: borderline personality disorder. Mental health is not what took her life, not directly at least, but a lost battle against infection. That Quintana was adopted plays a big part in the book and is one of the most powerful themes: Didion's reflection about the 'recommended choice narrative' and Quintanas question \"What if you didn't choose me?\" is as relatable as it is gut-wrenching.\n\nIt's hard to imagine what my impression of \"Blue Nights\" would have been without knowing \"The Year Of Magical Thinking\". It is often the case with memoirist writing that its power stems from the layers - in volume as in sophistication and arrangement. And I feel like Didion's two memoirs, as sad as they might be, are amazingly rich and deep.\n\nIn my last review I mentioned the problem of privilege in Didion's writing and this makes it harder at times to relate to her. In Blue Nights she makes an attempt to address this topic, when she asks whether Quintana had a privileged childhood or not. The answer comes down to \"I mean, we weren't *that* rich…\". Maybe this would have needed a more elaborate treatment.\n\nI really liked this book and I am surprised how much I managed to write about it, or rather my thoughts about it, here. I like Didion as a memoirist, too. I am not so sure that I will ever check out her more literary works. I actually rarely do that after having consumed memoirs of writers or artists. No, it's the mundane and not so mundane everyday stuff - or rather its heightened, polished reflective version - that interests me.\n\nOne last time back to the book: \"Blue Nights\" is a great book about mourning, about aging, about being a parent and a writer. Didion is steeped in a way of life that I would guess only exists in its fossilized forms, in memories. The relatable topics and the now lost to us extravagance of old Hollywood produce a rich, deep and at times paradoxical memoir that I would especially recommend if you can spare the time to consume \"The Year Of Magical Thinking\" beforehand.\n",

After the sudden death of her husband and the hospitalization of her daughter, Didion finds herself detached from reality and has to claw herself back to reason.

To be clear, what Didion focusses on is not this desire to skip the lowly emotions and loss of control that are part of the human condition. But, to me, she exemplifies how hard it is to accept the necessity of being a passenger, not the driver, for a while after an event like this.</p>\n<p>One strength of Didion&rsquo;s writing is that she can put a finger on the power of slightly changed emphases.

The critique goes something like this: Martha Stewart is a fraud, because she pretends to be a simple homemaker, like her fans, even though in reality she is a driven business woman who created merely an artifice of being a homemaker. Didion is directing her more empathetic read of Stewart mainly against Jerry Oppenheimer&rsquo;s unauthorized investigative Book on her: Just Desserts.

The question is: Does this take away from her writing? And the answer is: Yes, a little bit. I wouldn&rsquo;t go so far to suggest that I can&rsquo;t relate or that what she has to say is not interesting, quiet the opposite, but because Didion&rsquo;s voice is one of careful reexamination (it reminds of the idiom &ldquo;show me, I&rsquo;m from Missouri&rdquo;) and her reputation is one of popularizing counter culture, of problematizing the American Dream I can&rsquo;t deny that the success, although earned, subverts a little bit her persona, her self-conception or the frame from which I read her (so maybe, probably, this is on me). It complicates the relationship between me, the reader (or listener in my case), and her, the counter culture writer. Now, I am not owed an uncomplicated relationship. But I do have to admit that the contrast of a now wealthy writer that came from a place of socially conscious reporting - and still has those instincts but lives a totally different life - lead to some cognitive dissonance. It totally makes sense that lives like this exist. She is not the first, nor the last that will have had also monetary success from writing empathetically about various social issues.

				"content_html": "<p>A favorite book of mine is one that looks back. One that is thickly layered in the complications of the author&rsquo;s view. I don&rsquo;t think I knew this or could state this as plainly before this book. For a while I assumed it was weakness to be interested in this somewhat incomplete form - is that even the right word? - that is, autobiographical writing. But I love writing that leaves room for one&rsquo;s own thoughts. And I therefore loved this book which is a prime example of doing the form justice: The Art Of The Wasted Day by Patricia Hampl.</p>\n<p>It sounds like a straight up self-help book than it is. It is much more a beautiful mix of memoir and essay that circles around the topic of leisure and how it relates to writing, describing and living in general. What is great about these kinds of books is their way of heightening and compressing reality in its descriptions without loosing the connection to it. And so nothing is ever just the cause of anything or arranges itself neatly into a narrative ark. We might construe easy cause-and-effect relationships between the defining moments of our lives but at the same time we know - if we take the time to notice - that it is much more complex than that. Nowadays there is nothing more boring than a too neatly arranged story.</p>\n<p>While Hampl wrote this book, her husband died from a heart disease. Her longing to see him again, her struggles of not being able to believe - as a person being raised in the Catholic Faith no less - that there could actually be another side, where he would wait for her… I could feel that - as somebody raised devoid of any religion (Post-GDR east Berlin). I can imagine how this - having to realize that the partner you miss is gone for good, this person you spent most of your time with, the one which also happens to be your first reader - must have felt. This entanglement builds a lot of the emotional scaffolding in the book. I think it was pretty effective and lends the book a nice counterweight to Hampls beautifully written investigations of a leisurely life.</p>\n<p>I liked how history and especially her engagement with history writing made it possible to look over the author&rsquo;s shoulder while she discovers new wrinkles in the story of the Ladies of Llangollen - two Irish Women - who sought to live a &ldquo;life of retirement&rdquo; in the Welsh countryside in the 18th century - only to become famous for it. Montaigne is an important part of this book, too. He is her patron saint of description, observation and as the inventor of the essay an important corner stone of reflection. He is the poster child of the art of the wasted day. In another part of the book, she visits the almost forgotten but now famous proto-geneticist Gregor Mendel as well. He never managed to pass the exam to become a teacher. So he instead lived the life of a monk.</p>\n<p>Monks and Nuns are a big topic of the book. If not literally then figuratively, most of the people that are practicing the art of the wasted day are living a fairly structured life - an interesting paradox. But monastery life is not only structured but also slow. A structure followed slowly lends itself to being contemplative, to taking the time to observe and also describe. This kind of life, behind real or metaphorical walls might be a life lived in solitude (or: alone, but not lonely), is a life in which you are not needed all the time, not  interrupted constantly, a life where your input, your action is not demanded all the time, where you can come to rest on the <em>passing</em> within and around you, as Montaigne might have put it.</p>\n<p>The descriptions of her historical case studies are interwoven with her own life accounts. It&rsquo;s all the stuff I love about this form of writing: vignettes, reflections, beautiful descriptions. Like in the end, where she and her husband travel down the Mississippi river in an old wooden cabin boat, seeing her home state from a different angle and therefore very differently than ever before.</p>\n<p>The book also includes some well-reasoned advice. I loved her description of an anecdote in which a student of hers - she teaches writing at the University of Minnesota - didn&rsquo;t know what to write about himself, because he only came from Fridley (one of many the suburbs of Minneapolis):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I stared at him. I didn’t, for a moment, comprehend that this was the dark disclosure, this the occasion of his misery: being from Fridley meant, surely, that he had nothing to say. In effect, had no life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There it was again—nothin’ had ever happened to him and I was asking him to write about it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I have good news for you, Tommy,” I said. “The field’s wide open—nobody has told what it’s like to grow up in Fridley yet. It’s all yours.” (p. 185)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This passage was really eye-opening for me and put a finger on an important insight: Autobiographical writing doesn&rsquo;t need to be anchored by an exceptional life. Or rather: Any life can be made to be interesting.</p>\n<p>While writing this review I was googling around trying to find information about the book and its contents - I had listened to it through my local library - and I am a forgetful person. The book seemed to have gotten middling reviews in the aggregate. So I guess it&rsquo;s not a book for everyone and who knows if I would&rsquo;ve liked it as much, if I would&rsquo;ve read instead of listening to it. Parts of the magic of a book like this lie in the <em>sound</em> - and since Hampl reads this herself we really get an impression of the sound she was aiming for.</p>\n<p>For me it was an inspiring listen that made me write a lot more over the last three weeks and rediscover my love for memoirists writing like this.</p>\n<p>If you are interested to see if this is for you: There is <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2018/04/17/the-ladies-who-were-famous-for-wanting-to-be-left-alone/\">an excerpt about the Ladies of Llangollen on Longreads</a>.

And so nothing is ever just the cause of anything or arranges itself neatly into a narrative ark. We might construe easy cause-and-effect relationships between the defining moments of our lives but at the same time we know - if we take the time to notice - that it is much more complex than that. Nowadays there is nothing more boring than a too neatly arranged story.\n\nWhile Hampl wrote this book, her husband died from a heart disease. Her longing to see him again, her struggles of not being able to believe - as a person being raised in the Catholic Faith no less - that there could actually be another side, where he would wait for her… I could feel that - as somebody raised devoid of any religion (Post-GDR east Berlin). I can imagine how this - having to realize that the partner you miss is gone for good, this person you spent most of your time with, the one which also happens to be your first reader - must have felt. This entanglement builds a lot of the emotional scaffolding in the book. I think it was pretty effective and lends the book a nice counterweight to Hampls beautifully written investigations of a leisurely life.\n\nI liked how history and especially her engagement with history writing made it possible to look over the author's shoulder while she discovers new wrinkles in the story of the Ladies of Llangollen - two Irish Women - who sought to live a \"life of retirement\" in the Welsh countryside in the 18th century - only to become famous for it. Montaigne is an important part of this book, too. He is her patron saint of description, observation and as the inventor of the essay an important corner stone of reflection. He is the poster child of the art of the wasted day. In another part of the book, she visits the almost forgotten but now famous proto-geneticist Gregor Mendel as well. He never managed to pass the exam to become a teacher. So he instead lived the life of a monk.\n\nMonks and Nuns are a big topic of the book. If not literally then figuratively, most of the people that are practicing the art of the wasted day are living a fairly structured life - an interesting paradox. But monastery life is not only structured but also slow. A structure followed slowly lends itself to being contemplative, to taking the time to observe and also describe. This kind of life, behind real or metaphorical walls might be a life lived in solitude (or: alone, but not lonely), is a life in which you are not needed all the time, not  interrupted constantly, a life where your input, your action is not demanded all the time, where you can come to rest on the *passing* within and around you, as Montaigne might have put it.\n\nThe descriptions of her historical case studies are interwoven with her own life accounts. It's all the stuff I love about this form of writing: vignettes, reflections, beautiful descriptions. Like in the end, where she and her husband travel down the Mississippi river in an old wooden cabin boat, seeing her home state from a different angle and therefore very differently than ever before.\n\nThe book also includes some well-reasoned advice. I loved her description of an anecdote in which a student of hers - she teaches writing at the University of Minnesota - didn't know what to write about himself, because he only came from Fridley (one of many the suburbs of Minneapolis):\n\n>I stared at him. I didn’t, for a moment, comprehend that this was the dark disclosure, this the occasion of his misery: being from Fridley meant, surely, that he had nothing to say. In effect, had no life.\n\n>There it was again—nothin’ had ever happened to him and I was asking him to write about it.\n\n>“I have good news for you, Tommy,” I said. “The field’s wide open—nobody has told what it’s like to grow up in Fridley yet. It’s all yours.” (p. 185)\n\nThis passage was really eye-opening for me and put a finger on an important insight: Autobiographical writing doesn't need to be anchored by an exceptional life. Or rather: Any life can be made to be interesting.\n\nWhile writing this review I was googling around trying to find information about the book and its contents - I had listened to it through my local library - and I am a forgetful person. The book seemed to have gotten middling reviews in the aggregate. So I guess it's not a book for everyone and who knows if I would've liked it as much, if I would've read instead of listening to it. Parts of the magic of a book like this lie in the *sound* - and since Hampl reads this herself we really get an impression of the sound she was aiming for.\n\nFor me it was an inspiring listen that made me write a lot more over the last three weeks and rediscover my love for memoirists writing like this.\n\nIf you are interested to see if this is for you: There is [an excerpt about the Ladies of Llangollen on Longreads](https://longreads.com/2018/04/17/the-ladies-who-were-famous-for-wanting-to-be-left-alone/). And here is [a short clip](https://www.audiofilemagazine.com/reviews/read/140858/the-art-of-the-wasted-day-by-patricia-hampl-read-by-patricia-hampl/) of Hampl's performance of the beginning of the book's chapter entitled \"To Go\".\n",

				"content_html": "<p>When I was looking through my DayOne posts - the recent acquisition of the journaling app by automattic made me curious; I had not been using the app in a couple of years - I stumbled upon a journal entry that included a few screenshots of tweets that a quite popular German political Twitterer (maybe 30k followers back then, now around 50k followers) had posted, that berated me fiercely. How stupid I was and how dare I speak up against this person. They called me a baboon that needed to be put into place amongst other things. I think they called me sexist, too. I didn&rsquo;t have the heart to plunge deeper into the post. As I was simply too shocked. I had completely forgotten about this life altering experience half a decade ago. But here it was. And the remembering began.</p>\n<p>What had happened? When I was studying history of science and technology I was not shy to speak up. I was a young man that deemed himself smart and with a talent for research. I also had way too much time on my hands, which made me &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; in class. I read and studied furiously. And what I learned I wanted to apply. That is, nothing went past me in class. Any little uncertainty that came up, I problematized - to the frustration of my professors, I&rsquo;m sure, as well as my classmates. I wanted to be a researcher, or no, I wanted to be a prodigy. A person with great potential to become an exceptional researcher. I dreamt big. And I wanted my professors to see how smart I was. I had this dream that somebody would take me under their wing, make me behave, by offering a path to a career in research. I wanted to be tamed, I think, so that I could become the beautiful, creative researcher that I thought I ought to be.</p>\n<p>In any case, this phase of my life was a messy one and so were the discussions in the seminars. Lots of arguments, lots and lots of monologuing on my part. Oh, my poor classmates, forgive me! But that&rsquo;s who I was back then and although I look back with shame, I would be lying if I would not point out that this time of my life was one of the most instructive phases of it as well.</p>\n<p>I remember neither subject of the course nor the specific book introduction, chapter or article that we were assigned to read for this weeks class. What I do remember is that I disagreed vehemently with the author&rsquo;s premise that nobody had as of yet <em>really</em> looked into the topic at hand, except herself. That the author was female was incidental to my disagreement. But I never liked this take. To me, history was all about uncovering more and more aspects of the past. And a new take was adding a new shade, a new layer to the beautiful complexities of historiography as it related to the topic at hand. There is no singular fundamental take on history that subsumes all other takes - or at least not for long. History is best, I thought, if it was a humbling exercise, one in which your own strong opinions and values get somewhat relativized. History, to me, was a quest for authenticity, for serious inquiry, that ought not to bend to the political fashions of the day - even if I happen to agree with them. History ought to be historicist, in the German sense, where the understanding of a happening stems from a process of trying to find plausibility in the actions through sympathy for the actors - no matter how vile their behavior would be deemed, probably rightfully so, in our time. In short I was a young man looking for authenticity in a world full of ironic takes. I craved sincerity. &ldquo;Be real with me&rdquo;, I thought often, &ldquo;I want to like you&rdquo;. &ldquo;I want to be sure that you like me&rdquo;, if you say so, too. I was lonely and longed for reliability.</p>\n<p>It was well known amongst history of science students back then, that we had a minor celebrity in our midst. This person was a young politician of some clout. An up-and-comer that had gotten a taste of political authority, of respect towards their own person, after being elected to the city&rsquo;s parliament. They were invited to talk shows and interviewed a few times for TV and radio back then. They carried the aura of demanding respect into our classroom as well. Wearing nice long woolen coats, good fitting suits and expensive looking scarfs, not at all what the rest of us normals wore and especially not me, the wild man in the shabby cloths. They were standing out. They had understood that clothes make the person. At the same time their public persona was one of irony, of trolling for the greater good, or what they perceived as the greater good. They were a postmodern politician. One that always seemed to play both sides of the un/certainty coin: Claiming &ldquo;Facts first!&rdquo; but being crowned troll of the year some years earlier.</p>\n<p>The actual quarrel around which I have been circulating for this handful of paragraphs is explained quickly: My adversary had read the text different than me - or not differently, but more affirmatively. The claim of a fundamental take did not repel them, quite the opposite. They bought the author&rsquo;s points about what others had overlooked, maybe they bought the idea of a perfect all-encompassing historical take as well? I wasn&rsquo;t sure back then, but I was sure that history doesn&rsquo;t bend to a totalitarian approach. Writing history is a process of picking and choosing, of simplification. So I argued against their notion, vehemently. That the author had a feminist viewpoint - which was so incidental to my points - became the linchpin of the discussion. To this day I am sure of this: Even a struggle so central to modern societal progress as equality can only ever be an aspect of historiography. You may base a whole career on feminist history - and that would be an important pursuit - but nobody would claim everything is said and done when we have told all there is to tell about this struggle. No. No! And again: No!</p>\n<p>I would like to claim that I stayed as calm as I am now, writing all this down however many years later, but that would be a lie. We shouted at each other. I didn&rsquo;t permit this person, or my professor for that matter, to have the last word. I was incapable to give in, to allow this person to lug his intimidating aura around to steamroll me. After all, this was academia! Or its impoverished simulacrum at least. And arguments ought to count more than any accomplishments in other arenas of society here. Finally, the person just left in the middle of the class, infuriated, slamming the door. I was about to make another remark about their bad attitude, but was silenced by my professor: &ldquo;Martin!&rdquo; He only shouted this one word. My name. &ldquo;Martin!&rdquo; &ldquo;There it was&rdquo;, I thought. Finally an acknowledgement. I felt oddly good. I felt put into place. And wasn&rsquo;t this what I wanted? To be put into place?</p>\n<p>A few hours later, still pumped up from the altercation, I learned that my opponent had posted the tweets they did. I don&rsquo;t think they assumed that I was a Twitter user or would seek ought their timeline - if they cared at all. I found myself in an exceptional situation: I could read what another person that didn&rsquo;t like me thought about me. They just had put it out there for anyone to read. That included me and their kinda big audience. Some people liked those tweets, others retweeted them. And even though I knew, intellectually, that these tweets weren&rsquo;t meant for me or were in the end about me, really (they were about this persons anger), I felt deeply hurt. I felt seen, in a bad way. I felt revealed, caught. I felt like I was laughable. The whole village, <em>their</em> village, had it out for me, pointing, be it in anger or amusement about this anti-feminist idiot, who came to town, unbidden, to insult the mayor with his retrograde ideas, the fool, not even able to see how antiprogressive he is. I felt my artifice was visible as such. The political ascriptions didn&rsquo;t bother me, because they weren&rsquo;t accurate. But the persona that was described between the lines did. This mess of piled up insecurities that held up the disguise of an eager student was laid bare. There I was, in my most unfavorable interpretation. However, I couldn&rsquo;t deny the fact that it was a possible interpretation. It had a connection to reality. Yes, I was a self-serious jerk. And I knew it, I realized it, sometimes. And in this moment, I could see it clearly, I wasn&rsquo;t the only one who was aware.

And I couldn&rsquo;t point to this vignette as the cause for things being different from there on out. I carried on a couple of years longer with this prodigy-jerk persona, before it finally clicked that this wasn&rsquo;t the way. Erosion takes its time.
