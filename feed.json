However, a blog needs some form of a (design) theme and so I have generally opted for whatever the default is. The default is going to be maintained no matter what so it&rsquo;s a pretty safe bet. One thing that irks me a lot about micro.blog&rsquo;s default theme: How invisible the categories are! They are only visible on the archive page, not in the list of posts and not on the single post page either. I find this very impractical, because you can&rsquo;t browse other posts in the same category. Another thing is that the default theme doesn&rsquo;t do proper pagination. The homepage just includes 20 or so posts and that&rsquo;s it. You have to go to the archive page to see more posts, but there they are only visible in a truncated fashion.

				"content_html": "<p>Quick little story: I was working on a relatively big task to duplicate a bunch of data in a system I barely know. Now, the biggest problem here was that the data in question was hierarchical sql data. That makes it tricky because relational tables (rows and columns) are not well suited to make it easy to traverse such trees. You could relatively easily use a migration logger functionality and click through the UI on the backend to record the sql that you need to migrate this data. But this gets messy quick and can go easily wrong. The more data you need to duplicate the more important it is that you do the right thing for an increasingly long sequence of manual actions. Also there is cleanup necessary afterwards, since the migration logger is not optimizing its lightly abstracted sql statements well. On top of that, I could not find a good interface to program my migration against either. It seemed that my options were:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>use the UI and record the changes using the migration logger</li>\n<li>write what you need using raw sql yourself</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I decided to go with option 2. I found a great solution that did not require a nested set approach called a recursive common table expression. I felt like a genius. I also was sitting on my high horse, &ldquo;How did no one ever come up with a good API for doing common things like: copying this entity over onto this branch? Well, I guess I have to do it myself…&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Even though progress was made to create migration helper functionality, it was slow and I had lots of questions regarding the structure of the data I was supposed to duplicate.</p>\n<p>Yesterday my boss took 2 hours of his time to look at the problem with me. He pointed out that what I had been doing for the last three days was unnecessary. Of course, what could be done in the UI in the backend could also be accomplished programmatically. It wasn&rsquo;t even that hard. It had all the scaffolding for customization of the process I could have ever wanted. This will allow me to write a readable migration in a few hundred lines, with no later cleanup necessary. We solved a big chunk of my problem in no time.</p>\n<p>I was embarrassed.

				"content_text": "Quick little story: I was working on a relatively big task to duplicate a bunch of data in a system I barely know. Now, the biggest problem here was that the data in question was hierarchical sql data. That makes it tricky because relational tables (rows and columns) are not well suited to make it easy to traverse such trees. You could relatively easily use a migration logger functionality and click through the UI on the backend to record the sql that you need to migrate this data. But this gets messy quick and can go easily wrong. The more data you need to duplicate the more important it is that you do the right thing for an increasingly long sequence of manual actions. Also there is cleanup necessary afterwards, since the migration logger is not optimizing its lightly abstracted sql statements well. On top of that, I could not find a good interface to program my migration against either. It seemed that my options were:\n\n1. use the UI and record the changes using the migration logger\n2. write what you need using raw sql yourself\n\n\nI decided to go with option 2. I found a great solution that did not require a nested set approach called a recursive common table expression. I felt like a genius. I also was sitting on my high horse, \"How did no one ever come up with a good API for doing common things like: copying this entity over onto this branch? Well, I guess I have to do it myself…\" \n\nEven though progress was made to create migration helper functionality, it was slow and I had lots of questions regarding the structure of the data I was supposed to duplicate.\n\nYesterday my boss took 2 hours of his time to look at the problem with me. He pointed out that what I had been doing for the last three days was unnecessary. Of course, what could be done in the UI in the backend could also be accomplished programmatically. It wasn't even that hard. It had all the scaffolding for customization of the process I could have ever wanted. This will allow me to write a readable migration in a few hundred lines, with no later cleanup necessary. We solved a big chunk of my problem in no time.\n\nI was embarrassed. Not only did I underestimate my colleagues and the maintainers before me, I also underestimated the system and its capabilities. I felt especially bad, because I thought I had done the right thing, like asking many questions and communicating with the project management why there was such a delay. I thought I was dealing with a hard problem - and in a vacuum it actually was a hard problem - but instead I just didn't know where to look or what to ask.\n\nIt's a new day and I think I take a bunch of lessons from this:\n\n1. Ask more directly: Do not ask \"Is it guaranteed that every group starts with a node that has itself no parent?\", but ask \"Is there an API to copy categories just like the UI has?\". See also: [The XY Problem](https://xyproblem.info/).\n2. Be okay with making such mistakes. I am new in the company. It is almost inevitable that I will run in circles and it may take some time before my knowledge of the system matches my level of general problem solving skills. Because I could have solved the hard problem - which is why I tackled it - I just didn't need to.\n3. Accept your expertise level. As I said I am new here and at the same time I have programmed for a while so I generally know what I'm doing. This is a great recipe for falling prey to the Dunning–Kruger effect: That is overestimating one's ability in a particular context.

				"content_html": "<p><em>TL;DR: In light of the growing importance of digital services, we ought to consider modern software quality in relation to its environmental impact as well. This is more easily possible thanks to using automated software quality tools and continuous integration.</em></p>\n<p>Being a programmer means being privileged: You&rsquo;re generally sought after, payed well and enjoy freedoms and perks that other workers could only dream of. I think this still is true even though there have been many tech lay-offs recently. It&rsquo;s not like programmers became obsolete. On average software developers have it pretty good.</p>\n<p>In any case, working in software development brings with it also a big responsibility: To at least ponder the consequences of our actions as an industry. Up to and including what that means for the industry in my country (and Europe as a whole in my case), my company, my team and myself.</p>\n<p>There are lots of things to consider like privacy issues, accessibility issues and - more and more, although it&rsquo;s not a new thing - environmental issues.</p>\n<p>Because of how the world works, even actually pondering those issues at work almost never happens. It&rsquo;s not really part of the discussion - lip service aside - when considering changes to a software system.</p>\n<p>I acknowledge the importance of all the ethical issues named und unnamed above, but want to concentrate on environmental issues here: The tech industry as a whole is constantly incentivized to offer and use more resources: It has become standard to expect new computers to be faster and so newer software tends to be more resource hungry than older software. What does that mean, exactly? Well, new hardware needs resources in production to make all the chips, cards, and so on, that&rsquo;s obvious to anyone. But resources are also needed  when using our hardware: A modern laptop generally doesn&rsquo;t require that much power to be used by us, but what about the internet? The data centers that host most of the services we use today and that make up a big part of our modern understanding of what using a computing device should feel like, are insanely resource hungry.

After all, modern businesses model their processes in software, report, plan and reflect in software and are maybe even selling software products through software market places. Business processes tend to be very complex, simply by virtue of having to deal with historical ballast, future visions, differing politics within the company and a shifting environment in which the software has to function, not to speak of the process itself, which touches many different stake holders that all need different things from a company to do their work.</p>\n<p>Because of this, the software development cycle of gathering requirements, implementation, testing and release has started - more than 10 years ago - to accumulate lots of automation tools that are being referred to as continuous integration (ci). For example: When you develop software you often want to make sure that your new feature works as expected before you release a new version of your software. For this, people have developed testing tools. So people would write not only the feature but also a test (or tests) to make sure that the feature does what it should: This basically means you would define inputs and expected outputs and make sure that the new feature returns those expected values, when feeding the defined inputs. When a developer runs their test, they can see that the new feature works. This is great, but it&rsquo;s even greater when used down the road: Because a newer feature could accidentally change the behavior of a system in an unexpected way. With tests you can make sure that deployed code is more resilient against such accidental changes.</p>\n<p>An important part of modern development is the code review. So a developer would implement a feature, write tests and send their changes as a merge request (or pull request) to a colleague for review purposes. That colleague would check for any missed requirements, errors in the implementation, code smells and so on. There is a little back and forth between reviewer and programmer and if all is well the code is approved and can be deployed to a test system for a quality assurance colleague to manually test the change, before it then finally finds its way into the &ldquo;live&rdquo; software version used by a normal user.</p>\n<p>The code review process is especially important in terms of code quality, that is, in terms of aspects of the code that are rarely user facing but nonetheless are a very important part of a resilient application - scalable, easy to test, easy to change, etc. In other words: code review is supposed to help and (often times) ensure a high standard of quality in the codebase.</p>\n<p>Back to ci: Continuous integration can automatically find and often times fix a great many problems with new - and old, outdated - code. First of all, it can run all the software tests to ensure backwards compatibility. It can also run a linter, which ensures a consistent style (indentation, order of parts of code, naming scheme, etc.). This improves readability and ensures that a person familiar with one part of the system doesn&rsquo;t need to parse everything about this unknown part of the system: the files look the same and things are generally named as you would expect them to be, and so on.</p>\n<p>You can go further. You can let a static analysis tool run, to catch things like giving the wrong inputs to a function (e.g. input is a floating number, but this function expects an integer; in a dynamically typed language like PHP you might catch this error only when the code is actually run - but you want to catch that mistake and fix it before it is encountered in the wild). There are many, many other things where static analysis of a codebase in light of new changes can reveal problems that would otherwise go unnoticed until it&rsquo;s too late.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s automated testing, linting, static analysis and more tools like &ldquo;mess detectors&rdquo; that try to detect valid code but that constitutes generally considered bad programming practices. All of these tools would run before a code reviewer even gets to see the code. Issues with agreed upon standards will be brought up and fixed - in some cases even automatically - before another human even has to see the code. This in the end saves time, improves focus - because humans are not good in spotting standard violations and even prevents some lengthy discussions in some cases - because the machine is dispassionate and just enforces a standard that was agreed upon in the company.</p>\n<p>But you can go further. A relatively new idea is to also take software architecture into account when talking about ci. Software architecture is a whole can of worms in itself, but one important concern, as an example, is modularity: You want your code neatly organized so that the whole system stays open to replacement, improvement, extension, change, and so on. You could make sure, for example, that different parts of the system do not talk directly with each other, by defining application layers that separate different parts of the system from another to ensure a sensible organizational structure of the whole. Well, you can test for that in your ci pipeline - the pipeline is what runs all your defined code quality tools, linters and so on - as well, by defining an &ldquo;architectural fitness function&rdquo;:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the 2017 book Building Evolutionary Architectures (O’Reilly), the authors (Neal Ford, Rebecca Parsons, and Patrick Kua) defined the concept of an architectural fitness function: any mechanism that performs an objective integrity assessment of some architecture characteristic or combination of architecture characteristics.\n— <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-the/9781492086888/\">Software Architecture: The Hard Parts, &ldquo;Using Fitness Functions&rdquo;</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With a function defined you can also write a test in a tool like <a href=\"https://github.com/carlosas/phpat\">phpat</a>.

				"content_text": "*TL;DR: In light of the growing importance of digital services, we ought to consider modern software quality in relation to its environmental impact as well. This is more easily possible thanks to using automated software quality tools and continuous integration.*\n\nBeing a programmer means being privileged: You're generally sought after, payed well and enjoy freedoms and perks that other workers could only dream of. I think this still is true even though there have been many tech lay-offs recently. It's not like programmers became obsolete. On average software developers have it pretty good.\n\nIn any case, working in software development brings with it also a big responsibility: To at least ponder the consequences of our actions as an industry. Up to and including what that means for the industry in my country (and Europe as a whole in my case), my company, my team and myself.\n\nThere are lots of things to consider like privacy issues, accessibility issues and - more and more, although it's not a new thing - environmental issues.\n\nBecause of how the world works, even actually pondering those issues at work almost never happens. It's not really part of the discussion - lip service aside - when considering changes to a software system.\n\nI acknowledge the importance of all the ethical issues named und unnamed above, but want to concentrate on environmental issues here: The tech industry as a whole is constantly incentivized to offer and use more resources: It has become standard to expect new computers to be faster and so newer software tends to be more resource hungry than older software. What does that mean, exactly? Well, new hardware needs resources in production to make all the chips, cards, and so on, that's obvious to anyone. But resources are also needed  when using our hardware: A modern laptop generally doesn't require that much power to be used by us, but what about the internet? The data centers that host most of the services we use today and that make up a big part of our modern understanding of what using a computing device should feel like, are insanely resource hungry. Take this example of data centers using fresh water to cool its facilities: \n\n>In The Dalles, Oregon, Google was found to be using a quarter of the city’s water supply to cool its facilities. Tech companies have been facing pushback elsewhere in the United States, but also across the world in places like Uruguay, Chile, the Netherlands, Ireland, and New Zealand.

If you look at <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/functions/\">the list of available functions in hugo</a>, you will know that a function was exported, but not why.

The <code>ByDate.Reverse</code> part is used (and available only) on <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/templates/lists/#what-is-a-list-page-template\">list pages</a> - another detail you&rsquo;ll have to know - that is pages that have other pages under them in the file hierarchy.

Why you can&rsquo;t retrieve pages in similar manner on non list pages is unclear to me.</li>\n<li><code>&quot;Type&quot;</code> - This is the key parameter of the <code>where</code> function. The key is &ldquo;Type&rdquo; here. Why is <code>Type</code> capitalized? Maybe it has to because of exports? Maybe it&rsquo;s some other reason that I don&rsquo;t know. In any case it is part of the keys of the element that is kept (or discarded). For the pages array an element includes things like a <code>Permalink</code>, a published <code>Date</code> and a also a <code>Type</code>. How do you know what an element includes? Well, it&rsquo;s hard to say, because the <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/templates/template-debugging/#what-variables-are-available-in-this-context\">proposed solution</a> to use something like <code>&amp;#123;&amp;#123; printf &quot;%#v&quot; . }}</code> within a range function call that references the pages from the <code>Paginator</code> above only prints garbage.

But you&rsquo;ll not find this solution in the docs, you have to get lucky and find it in the forum or <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64163573/how-to-inspect-variables-in-the-current-scope-in-hugo\">Stack Overflow</a>.</li>\n<li><code>&quot;post&quot;</code> - this is the match parameter of the <code>where</code> function.

Would this have been what you'd come up with on the first try?\n\n```go-html-template\n{{ $allPosts := where .Site.Pages.ByDate.Reverse \"Type\" \"post\" }}\n{{ $allDailyDogos := where .Site.Pages \"Params.categories\" \"intersect\" (slice \"DailyDogo\") }}\n{{ $onlyDogos := intersect $allPosts $allDailyDogos }}\n{{ $paginator := .Paginate ($onlyDogos) (index .Site.Params \"archive-paginate\" | default 25) }}\n```\n\nSo far so good. How about the inverse? You'll find that there is no way to tell the line `$allDailyDogos` to simply do the inverse. There is no `\"not intersect\"` or whatever. You have to use another function called `symdiff`:\n\n```go-html-template\n{{ $allPosts := where .Site.Pages.ByDate.Reverse \"Type\" \"post\" }}\n{{ $allDailyDogos := where .Site.Pages \"Params.categories\" \"intersect\" (slice \"DailyDogo\") }}\n{{ $noDogos := symdiff $allDailyDogos $allPosts }}\n{{ $paginator := .Paginate ($noDogos) (index .Site.Params \"archive-paginate\" | default 25) }}\n```\n\nSymdiff is short for [symmetric difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_difference) and means here that we want all elements from the `$allPosts` array that are not part of the `$allDailyDogos` array. Meaning we are keeping only those posts, which is like filtering for the inverse of the `$onlyDogos` array from before.\n\nWe could have mashed this all into one line to make it totally unreadable, but I think this is instructive and it would have not been anymore readable in other template languages (if they even would've been able to deal with this as a one liner). Still:\n\n- Why do I need to make a slice/array out of \"DailyDogo\"?\n- Why is there no `NOT` operator? - it would've been nice in two instances: 1. inside the `where` function to save an extra call to `symdiff` or 2. as a better (I'd say) alternative to using `symdiff`, because people think more along the lines of \"all but not these kinds of things\" instead of \"symmetrical difference of these two sets\".\n- Why is it so hard to chain conditions to the `where` function to the point where you'd rather create two arrays instead of filtering the array down in one step?\n\nUgh. There is so much in just this one line - and the subsequent slight changes I have done - that I find weird and unergonomic. I hope I could also show that it's not complete and utter failure to understand what's going on, either. Sometimes things are just badly designed for the most obvious use cases in order to accommodate fancier goals. I'd rahter have a templating syntax/language that makes things easier. If that makes it more boring: Good. I'm here to improve my blog first and foremost.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I wonder if the dystopian looks of AR/VR headsets are really the problem. I can see that they don&rsquo;t translate well to PR story telling: People find it creepy to look at.</p>\n<p>But I do wonder if that even matters. If we think about people&rsquo;s desktop setups right now - with multiple displays, the users hunched over a keyboard, cables everywhere, big headphones cutting us off, probably looking at a wall, instead of the room - isn&rsquo;t this just as dystopian? What the current aesthetics of every day computing has going for itself in comparison to a headset blocking our view of the real(?) world is that you can make it look somewhat palatable in photos and videos.</p>\n<p>If you hide the cables and clean the desk, it can be made to look somewhat pleasing even. But that&rsquo;s not really how most computing places look.</p>\n<p>In practice there are finger prints, bread crumbs, cables not very well hidden, there is fan noise, dust, asymmetry. And then we sit in front of these machines for hours on end. Computers brake our bodies. There is nothing innocent about using &ldquo;normal&rdquo; computers today. This is true also for handheld devices.</p>\n<p>It seems to me that there are two directions to answer to this status quo. The first is a kind of digital ludditism: &ldquo;We should use less screens, we should go out, we should not be so dependent and addicted to our computing devices.&rdquo; The second is an optimistic affirmation of technological progress: &ldquo;All the computing around us is great, the future is bright. I&rsquo;m excited.&rdquo; And then there are mixed versions: &ldquo;Computers are great in moderation.&rdquo; Or: &ldquo;Computers are a necessary evil.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll add to the mix a stance that is all too often called fatalism: Computers are inevitable. And furthermore: There is no choice involved. It doesn&rsquo;t really matter if we like or dislike technology. What matters is if technology is able to reorganize society around itself sufficiently. If a technology - take the smartphone - is able to do so, we&rsquo;ll find all kinds of excuses - that&rsquo;s the wrong word, because there is no value judgement implied, but merely a description of a general discourse dynamic - to not find it creepy or dystopian.

				"content_text": "I wonder if the dystopian looks of AR/VR headsets are really the problem. I can see that they don't translate well to PR story telling: People find it creepy to look at.\n\nBut I do wonder if that even matters. If we think about people's desktop setups right now - with multiple displays, the users hunched over a keyboard, cables everywhere, big headphones cutting us off, probably looking at a wall, instead of the room - isn't this just as dystopian? What the current aesthetics of every day computing has going for itself in comparison to a headset blocking our view of the real(?) world is that you can make it look somewhat palatable in photos and videos.\n\nIf you hide the cables and clean the desk, it can be made to look somewhat pleasing even. But that's not really how most computing places look.\n\nIn practice there are finger prints, bread crumbs, cables not very well hidden, there is fan noise, dust, asymmetry. And then we sit in front of these machines for hours on end. Computers brake our bodies. There is nothing innocent about using \"normal\" computers today. This is true also for handheld devices.\n\nIt seems to me that there are two directions to answer to this status quo. The first is a kind of digital ludditism: \"We should use less screens, we should go out, we should not be so dependent and addicted to our computing devices.\" The second is an optimistic affirmation of technological progress: \"All the computing around us is great, the future is bright. I'm excited.\" And then there are mixed versions: \"Computers are great in moderation.\" Or: \"Computers are a necessary evil.\"\n\nI'll add to the mix a stance that is all too often called fatalism: Computers are inevitable. And furthermore: There is no choice involved. It doesn't really matter if we like or dislike technology. What matters is if technology is able to reorganize society around itself sufficiently. If a technology - take the smartphone - is able to do so, we'll find all kinds of excuses - that's the wrong word, because there is no value judgement implied, but merely a description of a general discourse dynamic - to not find it creepy or dystopian. In practice the reorganization has more to do with making certain kinds of activities more interesting, effective, productive - or, in short: more likely. If an activity sufficiently occurs mediated by a new technology - for whatever reason - that new technology will be adopted.\n\nAnd when it has been sufficiently adopted, perceived PR problems are none anymore. But let's not kid ourselves that it would be PR that makes this possible. PR can - maybe! - help to establish some use cases or open the door, but it's the actual use that leads to an uptake in the likelihood of (mediated) activities. And that's where the difference lies.

				"title": "My Current Thoughts On Therapy And Mental Health",
				"content_html": "<blockquote>\n<p>Part of my depression is a degree of apathy; the more I can focus and get excited about something the more I feel I&rsquo;m on the right path. I do worry, however, that it&rsquo;s a mask and I&rsquo;m just distracting myself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And that&rsquo;s how I feel about all this in a wider context. Treatment and therapy don&rsquo;t magically make you a happy person. Instead, they mask the symptoms or provide better coping strategies, ways to head off the worst of it before it can take hold.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://colinwalker.blog/blog/?date=2023-03-15#p1\">Colin Walker.</a></p>\n<p>As somebody who has had several mental health breakdowns and three therapists in my 20s (I&rsquo;m 36 now), my current perspective on therapy is that you create the world in which you&rsquo;re living in and therapy can give structure (and meds, if needed) towards creating a livable world, for you. Meaning that you are actually not just getting rid of yet another veil that makes you see things more clearly - or on the contrary putting another mask on to make you see things less clearly. Instead your world can&rsquo;t literaly be anything else than what you focus on. If you&rsquo;re focussing on being happy, coping and so on, chances are that your world &ldquo;becomes&rdquo; what you see.</p>\n<p>This is not as simple as just using willpower, however. Not least, because willpower is like a muscle and ego depletion is a real thing. It&rsquo;s also because depression can be thought of as an an active but independently acting agent in your consciousness: Deciding to want to focus on something else is important, but a mental illness wouldn&rsquo;t be called that, if you could &lsquo;just decide&rsquo; and stick to counteracting it.</p>\n<p>This is where therapy can be incredibly helpful: In my experience visiting with a therapist changes your environment, your habits, which is itself - not even taking into account their skill at treating you - an important step to creating lasting behavioral change. But therapists offer also structure on top of just existing in your environment. In my experience they offer a source of serendipity that makes it possible to reach break throughs, new frames of thinking, new ways of looking at things. By showing up and interacting with a therapist you&rsquo;re making a real effort to change what you believe to be the boundaries of your current situation. Yes, this can be in the form of recipe-like  coping strategies, but it can also just mean to interact with an expert on mental health. And that communication has a very high likelihood of being <em>surprising</em> - which is so important to feel something, anything <em>else</em> as regards to your current mental health.</p>\n<p>So in short: We are and our world is what we are focussing on. There is no trick here. Nothing is revealed or hidden by engaging differently with the world, instead it is just that: A different perspective, a different world. To make a sustained effort to change this perspective for good means to change the environment (because willpower alone won&rsquo;t cut it) and to being open to be surprised.</p>\n<p>Medicine can really help in some cases. But even then it&rsquo;s not guaranteed that your conscience is built to accommodate even one new way of perceiving the world that doesn&rsquo;t include your mental illness. People are different, they can and can&rsquo;t do different things. A goal for one person to be completely healed from depression might just simply not be in the cards for others. <em>However</em>: Even temporary relief or a more manageable severity of symptoms might be totally worth the effort.</p>\n<p>Finally, there is no relief in thinking that you may never find relief and therefore doing nothing. I would like to say: Whole-ass the thing, but I don&rsquo;t mean it to say &ldquo;don&rsquo;t do anything else&rdquo;, I mean it in the sense that if you&rsquo;re doing therapy, take it seriously, treat is as a creative task. The task of reinventing your world.</p>\n",

Meaning that you are actually not just getting rid of yet another veil that makes you see things more clearly - or on the contrary putting another mask on to make you see things less clearly. Instead your world can't literaly be anything else than what you focus on. If you're focussing on being happy, coping and so on, chances are that your world \"becomes\" what you see.\n\nThis is not as simple as just using willpower, however. Not least, because willpower is like a muscle and ego depletion is a real thing. It's also because depression can be thought of as an an active but independently acting agent in your consciousness: Deciding to want to focus on something else is important, but a mental illness wouldn't be called that, if you could 'just decide' and stick to counteracting it.\n\nThis is where therapy can be incredibly helpful: In my experience visiting with a therapist changes your environment, your habits, which is itself - not even taking into account their skill at treating you - an important step to creating lasting behavioral change. But therapists offer also structure on top of just existing in your environment. In my experience they offer a source of serendipity that makes it possible to reach break throughs, new frames of thinking, new ways of looking at things. By showing up and interacting with a therapist you're making a real effort to change what you believe to be the boundaries of your current situation. Yes, this can be in the form of recipe-like  coping strategies, but it can also just mean to interact with an expert on mental health. And that communication has a very high likelihood of being _surprising_ - which is so important to feel something, anything _else_ as regards to your current mental health.\n\nSo in short: We are and our world is what we are focussing on. There is no trick here. Nothing is revealed or hidden by engaging differently with the world, instead it is just that: A different perspective, a different world. To make a sustained effort to change this perspective for good means to change the environment (because willpower alone won't cut it) and to being open to be surprised.\n\nMedicine can really help in some cases. But even then it's not guaranteed that your conscience is built to accommodate even one new way of perceiving the world that doesn't include your mental illness. People are different, they can and can't do different things. A goal for one person to be completely healed from depression might just simply not be in the cards for others. _However_: Even temporary relief or a more manageable severity of symptoms might be totally worth the effort.\n\nFinally, there is no relief in thinking that you may never find relief and therefore doing nothing. I would like to say: Whole-ass the thing, but I don't mean it to say \"don't do anything else\", I mean it in the sense that if you're doing therapy, take it seriously, treat is as a creative task. The task of reinventing your world.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>This last year was not a great year. I wouldn&rsquo;t say it was as bad as 2021. But it was a challenging year. 2022 was a year of increasing uncertainty. There was (and is) war happening very close by (or at least that&rsquo;s how it feels). There is the economic down turn, which touches everything and everyone around me.</p>\n<p>I look back and see a year that was defined by trying to get a grip, finally (for the umpteenth time). I was successful for a while, but almost nothing I tried to do stuck throughout the year (and beyond): I did not become a <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/05/29/taking-a-break.html\">microcaster</a>, an <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/categories/the-early-riser/\">early riser</a>, a <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/notes-on-notes/\">newsletter writer</a>, for example. Notable exceptions: Duolingo (500+ days streak) and my <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/categories/dailydogo/\">DailyDogo</a> series of posts here on the blog. I started a side project that I will claim is still ongoing, even though I have not invested any time into it since mid December.</p>\n<p>Now, not all projects are meant to be continuous, or even meant to succeed. I know that and it&rsquo;s fine. I do appreciate the insight gained from projects more than their outcomes. Nonetheless it is gnawing at me that I do not have a lot to show in terms of progress regarding my own ideas. I feel like I ought to be capable enough to make things (bring side projects to a &ldquo;version 1&rdquo; state, continuously publish side projects that are ongoing, like newsletters), change or add habits, transform my surroundings in a positive manner, etc. I feel like I should be able to succeed sometimes, at least.</p>\n<p>Let me say it again: Despite what I just wrote, I do appreciate that I have not stood still and it would be wrong to claim that nothing good came out of me trying hard in whatever it may have been. I just feel like that I would like to be able to show <em>something</em> for the effort, something tangible.</p>\n<p>Take my note taking system for example: For literal decades (only 2, but that still warrants the plural) I have honed and refined my skill to take notes, to think in notes and therefore am able to think many interesting thoughts beyond what a single &ldquo;thought session&rdquo; may come up with. I feel like this makes me good at my job. It actually makes me good at <em>life</em> I&rsquo;ll claim, because my reflections are more mature and I do know myself better than without. The question is though: If I&rsquo;m so great, where are the results of me being good? I&rsquo;m a middling programmer - I do recognize that I started my career later than others and I know that I have not reached my ceiling and am far from it: I even made steps forward to becoming more proficient.

				"content_text": "This last year was not a great year. I wouldn't say it was as bad as 2021. But it was a challenging year. 2022 was a year of increasing uncertainty. There was (and is) war happening very close by (or at least that's how it feels). There is the economic down turn, which touches everything and everyone around me.\n\nI look back and see a year that was defined by trying to get a grip, finally (for the umpteenth time). I was successful for a while, but almost nothing I tried to do stuck throughout the year (and beyond): I did not become a [microcaster](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/05/29/taking-a-break.html), an [early riser](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/categories/the-early-riser/), a [newsletter writer](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/notes-on-notes/), for example. Notable exceptions: Duolingo (500+ days streak) and my [DailyDogo](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/categories/dailydogo/) series of posts here on the blog. I started a side project that I will claim is still ongoing, even though I have not invested any time into it since mid December.\n\nNow, not all projects are meant to be continuous, or even meant to succeed. I know that and it's fine. I do appreciate the insight gained from projects more than their outcomes. Nonetheless it is gnawing at me that I do not have a lot to show in terms of progress regarding my own ideas. I feel like I ought to be capable enough to make things (bring side projects to a \"version 1\" state, continuously publish side projects that are ongoing, like newsletters), change or add habits, transform my surroundings in a positive manner, etc. I feel like I should be able to succeed sometimes, at least.\n\nLet me say it again: Despite what I just wrote, I do appreciate that I have not stood still and it would be wrong to claim that nothing good came out of me trying hard in whatever it may have been. I just feel like that I would like to be able to show *something* for the effort, something tangible.\n\nTake my note taking system for example: For literal decades (only 2, but that still warrants the plural) I have honed and refined my skill to take notes, to think in notes and therefore am able to think many interesting thoughts beyond what a single \"thought session\" may come up with. I feel like this makes me good at my job. It actually makes me good at *life* I'll claim, because my reflections are more mature and I do know myself better than without. The question is though: If I'm so great, where are the results of me being good? I'm a middling programmer - I do recognize that I started my career later than others and I know that I have not reached my ceiling and am far from it: I even made steps forward to becoming more proficient. But still. I'm an okay writer (or was) - not in English, mind you - but where are the publications? I'm a pretty good thinker - but where are my contributions to a field, any field, that I have had academic training in (history, sociology, anthropology of science and technology and computer science)?\n\nIt seems to me that I'm caught in a stage of continuously drafting grand visions of my future if I look back through the many years of yearly reviews I have done. I'm pretty sick of it. In 2022 I already made a change towards not changing my plans, but instead refining them. I count this as my biggest professional success.

				"content_text": "<p>The more I read about how mastodon works, the happier I am that I ended up being so curious about the publishing options in <a href=\"https://ia.net/writer\">iA Writer</a> that I had to check out micro.blog about 1.5 years ago.</p>\n<p>Don't get me wrong: It's great that people are checking out mastodon. <a href=\"https://help.micro.blog/t/activitypub/95\">It lets me follow them on micro.blog.</a> But moderation and all the other social aspects of running a social network (even if it's \"just\" a timeline of blogs) are what's hard.</p>\n<p>Many people that are leaving Twitter right now (or at least create a mastodon account on the side, for the time after Twitter finally implodes) end up on <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/explore\">mastodon.social</a>, the biggest mastodon instance there is. When I scrolled through their explore timeline I was surprised to find a post by fellow corgi lover and micro.blogger Hollie Butler (<a href=\"https://micro.blog/hollie\">@hollie</a>) that urged people to find a better instance, because mastodon.social has had a bad moderation for a long time.</p>\n<p>In the replies to this post a user asked: Can I move my content over to a new (e.g. better moderated) instance? The answer is no. You can move the people you follow, but not your content, it seems.</p>\n<p>With micro.blog this combination of problems doesn't really exist. On the one hand they have and enforce community guidelines that protect the community against hate speech, harassment and so on. Community manager Jean MacDonald (<a href=\"https://micro.blog/jean\">@jean</a>) does an excellent job as far as I can tell. So there is no reason to move. Micro.blog is just a blog hoster with a social timeline component.</p>\n<p>On the other hand exporting your data is easy enough, too. Even if there would be a reason at some point to move: I do own all my content and it's not useless content, because a micro.blog is just a blog and so the content I'd export are just blog posts.</p>\n<p>The point is: At the moment micro.blog seems like the ideal place that is not twitter, but has moderation figured out (and still lets you connect to mastodon users). I feel like I'm in good hands with them. If you're willing to fiddle, you can connect your own blog for free, or you could pay them 5$ a month and have everything set up for you. Connect a domain and you really truly own your content, even in the case you feel the need to move away, since the permalinks point to your domain not micro.blog's (<a href=\"https://help.micro.blog/t/moving-micro-blog-hosted-blog-to-self-hosted/1201\">I'm not claiming the moving blog hosters is easy, but it's possible…</a>).</p>\n",

Wether it is note taking or coding, gaming or just watching youtube: I really like to use my Mac more than I like my iPad. The iPad is strictly better for cooking and is used frequently for that, but I have not used the machine to its full potential. I have noticed that I'm a very stationary person and like my current desk setup (private laptop on the left, KVM-enabled Display in the middle, work laptop on the right, <a href=\"https://ergodox-ez.com/\">Ergodox EZ</a> as my keyboard and Logitech MX Master 3 as my mouse), which doesn't include a real place for an iPad. I rarely work on the kitchen table - the only other spot really usable for writing/sitting down to do computer things in my home. Even when I'm traveling it's the laptop not the tablet that gets used.</p>\n<p>That being said I'm happy about owning an iPad Pro, too. I use it frequently enough to make it worth the purchase, even if I'm a light user of it. Next time around I probably would get a cheaper, more basic model. The Air is just plainly a great computer and I can't even conceive a justification for wanting more out of a private computer (which gets used for 1 to 8 hours a day, depending on if it's the weekend or free time after work).</p>\n",

I didn’t “live” in my notes as much as I like to do.</p>\n<p>Another big reason for being fine with paying the price of maintaining things myself is the recent development of Obsidian: it now supports multiple windows, something that Agenda lacks and something that makes distilling a bunch of notes into a new one pretty hard.</p>\n<p>Finally, I think that working on plugins for Obsidian is a way to lessen the load of maintenance and - since I’m a developer - a way to actually gain some expertise. So in my case, it is not a terrible investment of time and effort.</p>\n<p> </p>\n",

Otherwise either rely on the project management tools at work (tickets and kanban board) or use Reminders to make sure that things that need to be done but are not work in progress and/or are not work related won't be forgotten.</p>\n",

Once you upload the image, if you do [micro.blog/photos/](https://micro.blog/photos/#)##x/, but replace ### with the pixel width you want, followed by the full URL to the image, you’ll show an image with that width. For example, if I wanted the image at [json.blog/foo.jpg](https://json.blog/foo.jpg) to be 480px wide, I could use &lt;img src=“https://micro.blog/photos/480x/[json.blog/foo.jpg](https://json.blog/foo.jpg)”&gt;.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://help.micro.blog/t/optimal-image-size-resolution/427/2\">@jsonbecker in the Micro.Blog Forums</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This first page load still takes a long while, since my home page weighs in at about 25 mb of mostly image data.

No. But it is much more well suited out of the box for this kind of note taking.</p>\n<p>There is also a risk of drift: If you're trying to organize your notes, you probably don't do so just for the sake of it, but because you try to become better at doing other things. The notes and also the notes setup are just helping to accomplish a task at hand. If your setup is complicated and some parts are even written by yourself, you might end up accomplishing everything else but the task you set out to check off in the first place.</p>\n<p>Therefore, when I try to improve my current system, I always look for ways to use a less customized system. The more stock features I use the better. The burden of maintaining those features lies with the app developer.</p>\n<p>Of course, there will be lots of cases where a feature just doesn't exist. In that case I try to live without this feature first. Maybe I don't need it as much as I first thought. If I can't live without it, I look for a plugin solution, again, to lessen the maintenance load on myself. I have to be aware, that I may not need to maintain the plugin providing the feature, but I am now responsible to make it all work, i.e. the burden of maintenance of the integration of plugin and setup lies with me.</p>\n<p>Finally, I might write a plugin, script or customize an existing piece of code to make it do what I need it to do, but this is really a last resort. Very often this is not worth the time.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>My note taking system consists of three different pieces:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Timeless notes: Ideas, thoughts, etc. that are interlinked and are not time sensitive. These are often literally the base of knowledge from which I work. Here I try to distill what I have learned and try to push myself toward the new and the more generalized.</li>\n<li>Project notes: Status quos, todos and thoughts related to ongoing projects or tasks that have some kind of momentum but are more ephemeral than timeless notes.</li>\n<li>Journal notes: Notes that record what is happening or has happened so that I have a written record of aspects of my lived life.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Types 2 and 3 are very much related, although different in the sense, that a type 2 note is not necessarily interesting enough to be mentioned in a type 3 note. And a type 3 note is not so concerned with creating or maintaining momentum, but more with creating a record of what happened.</p>\n<p>Type one notes are different in the sense that they should be more interlinked and add up to trees of notes that in turn act serendipity-enhancing on the interface between thinking and writing (including coding). You want to treat those kinds of notes differently and keep them separate. This is where the good stuff lives. Insights from type 2 and 3 notes might end up becoming a type 1 note.</p>\n<p>A type 1 note is not the place to keep a record, though. It represents my latest stance on a topic, the latest formulation of an idea. They exist to be refactored and to be changed in any way that seems appropriate.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I work as a programmer for my day job. Right now I am working on two php projects. Coming from <a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com\">Sublime Text</a> but having had the need for more IDE features I came to love <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com\">Visual Studio Code</a> and made it my home. VS Code is a great editor for PHP development, especially if you use the <a href=\"https://intelephense.com\">Intelephense</a> extension. However, the bigger the project, the more it becomes apparent, that the performance of the language server is not <em>that</em> great.</p>\n<p>I lived with this for many months now. Yesterday I started working on a new issue and thought to myself: “All of my dev team members use <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/\">Jetbrains PHPStorm</a>, I should give it a try.”. I had used <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/\">Jetbrains Intelij Idea</a> for a brief moment a while back and only remembered being fairly unimpressed, but not exactly why I felt that way. Having now tried getting into their PHP IDE product, I have to say my impression has not really changed and now I also remember why.</p>\n<p>Although the code intelligence performance is clearly better, it is the small stuff that gets me. The impetus for this post for example was that you can’t use standard shell shortcuts with the integrated terminal: <code>Control + R</code> (backwards history search) being one of my most often used commands.</p>\n<p>I appreciated that they offer a keymap for people coming from Code to PHPStorm and as far as I can tell, the commands in it work. But customizing an IDE is more than just having the same default shortcuts for common tasks available in the new app. I have a bunch of my own shortcuts in code that use the pattern <code>CMD + H &lt;Key&gt;</code> (press <code>CMD + H</code> and then <code>&lt;Key&gt;</code>). I use <code>CMD + H</code>, because my last name start with H, so it was (and is) easier to remember. It just so happens that <code>CMD + H</code> is also a system wide shortcut for hiding an application. So when I tried to set up a frequently used shortcut to reveal the currently opened file in the sidebar navigation, <code>CMD + H S</code> the PHPStorm app was just hidden. In other words it did not “shadow” or override system shortcuts when asked. This feels even more arbitrary if we take those two things together: On the one hand standard shortcuts of the shell running inside the integrated terminal are shadowed per default - and this can also not be disabled -  and on the other hand wanting to shadow a system wide shortcut like <code>CMD + H</code> is not possible without remapping the shortcut within the OS. I feel like the IDE is not really playing along, but instead makes me jump through hoops.</p>\n<p>These are only two compounding cuts of a thousand that make PHPStorm hard to love in my opinion. I have an especially hard time understanding the design decisions to remove long standing functionality from a shell by shadowing standard shortcuts. It’s just a bad idea. It does explain why my colleagues never use the integrated terminal, but have an extra shell window open to the side, to run terminal commands.</p>\n<p>All in all I am very unimpressed by PHPStorm, but also worried: If the performance of Intelephense stays as bad much longer, I might have to look at other options. I know that Netbeans and Eclipse also have PHP features, I just don’t know anyone using, let alone loving these apps for PHP development…</p>\n\n[Forward.](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2023/07/10/phpstorms-keybinding-system.html)\n",

My thoughts after the keynote:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I couldn’t be more excited about the new iPadOS features</li>\n<li>I am slightly sad that the two new MacBook models - the new M2 MacBook Air and the new 13-inch MacBook Pro - would have been options for my needs and budget</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since the iPad Pro was supposed to be my main machine - not least because I wanted to see if that is possible and fun - I’m even more excited to double down on that. Yeah, I just bought the older MacBook Air, but I bought it because I assume that the light coding I’m doing in my free time and the heavier reading/writing/note taking/processing workflow I have, will lead me to use a machine that can run a less walled in OS with multitasking capabilities. We’ll see.</p>\n<p>I wonder if I would have picked a beefier M2 Air over my two machine solution, but I’m also happy I got both devices. We live in a time of exciting technology in which we can pick the right digital tool for the job at hand and I’m happy that I can experience this exciting future.</p>\n<p>In any case: My new hardware - I’m still waiting on my new Air - is/is going to be an amazing upgrade to my technological status quo. My personal laptop has been a 13-inch Mac Pro from 2013. And although that computer is still working (I just upgraded it to Monterey this morning!), it was time to upgrade. I’m really looking forward to leaving the sluggish, syrupy Mac experience behind.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/10/24/previously-after-using.html\">My thoughts after a few months of use</a></p>\n",

The complexity of getting notifications right increases when realizing that you have to set them up beforehand, which means you have to expect the future.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1.whatdoyounotwanttomiss-notwantingtomisssomethingdoesn’tmeanyouneedtoknowaboutitimmediately.\">1. What do you not want to miss? - Not wanting to miss something doesn’t mean you need to know about it immediately.</h3>\n<p>Missing something means that a change of state in my world passed me by. Notification, on or not: If I missed it, the knowledge of having missed it implies that I now know that my world has changed (it) and I noticed afterwards. For things I don’t want to miss, I am interested in the changed state of affairs. But this doesn’t mean that I need to know about it now.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2.isthechangeofstateinitselfimportant-achangeofthestatusquodoesn’tnecessarilymeantheinfoisgoingtoberelevantforeverorrelevanttemporarily.\">2. Is the change of state in itself important? - A change of the status quo doesn’t necessarily mean the info is going to be relevant forever (or relevant temporarily).</h3>\n<p>As compared to the things I don’t want to miss, here I’m more interested in the change of state: Something became available. A window of obligation/opportunity opened (or is about to close). Something was like <em>this</em> now it’s like <em>that</em>. Depending on the change, I might be interested in it forever or only for a limited period. In either case, time sensitivity itself is not the same as a change of state. It’s another property that alters this one.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3.howtimesensitiveisit-timesensitivityisnotthesameastheimportanceofthechangeoccurringortheimportanceofthenewstatusquo.\">3. How time sensitive is it? - Time sensitivity is not the same as the importance of the change occurring or the importance of the new status quo.</h3>\n<p>Time sensitivity doesn’t mean any change of state needs to be known now. Sometimes it needs to be known depending on a location or on a certain date and time. “Now” is one, but not the only possibility. The reasons for a notification being time sensitive can be manifold in practice. Abstractly speaking, it is a question of priority and urgency - which are also not the same thing.</p>\n<p>Whilst priority is trying to rank items by importance (which itself is a relative measure of impactfulness of the thing in question) to my world, urgency re-ranks those items according to currently open windows of opportunity and/or obligation.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Not only is it hard to keep all these distinctions in mind when I’m trying to predict my future, I’m also prone to getting it wrong, because my world is not made of numbers. Parts of my world aren’t measurable, some parts are not even comparable. Still other parts might not even be identifiable as parts!</p>\n<p>And if this wasn’t making it difficult enough, this is surely not even close to a complete description of the problem space and none of this is available to me objectively, either. So what to do?</p>\n<h2 id=\"keepingitsimple\">Keeping It Simple</h2>\n<h3 id=\"understandthenotificationsystemofyoursetup\">Understand the notification system of your setup</h3>\n<p>I’m an Apple user and have an iPhone, a work Mac, a personal Mac and an iPad. For me, it was important to understand that while focus modes can be shared across devices, the per-app notification settings are not.</p>\n<p>Which makes sense, since not every app is available, let alone installed on every device.</p>\n<p>Some notification specific settings are adjusted within the app itself, while others are adjusted through the settings of the os.</p>\n<h3 id=\"startwithnonotificationsbadgesanything\">Start with no notifications, badges, anything</h3>\n<p>By disabling all notifications (individually), I am making sure that noise doesn’t even reach me. The default answer to any new app asking for permission to push notifications to me is “No”.</p>\n<p>Same goes for badges, space on my home screen, or an app even getting installed. By radically reducing the apps that I have to manage, I reduce the problem a lot, by following this principled approach.</p>\n<h3 id=\"trytheleastdistractingsimplethingfirst\">Try the least distracting, simple thing first</h3>\n<p>I knew some apps needed some way to inform me. And although my analysis above was important to get a feel for the difficulty of the problem, an 80% solution for 20% of effort may be good enough in practice. So I try that first for any app that actually really needs to inform me.</p>\n<p>The harder part of this heuristic is figuring out what the least distracting thing is. I find a badge count of the right measure to be pretty good. But sometimes, actual notifications on one or more devices might be the obvious choice.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ifidon’tactonitiremoveit\">If I don’t act on it, I remove it</h3>\n<p>If something is only noise to me, it’s not worth getting informed about. Remove, simplify.</p>\n<h3 id=\"managethebaselinefirst\">Manage the baseline first</h3>\n<p>Before even getting into things like focus modes, I make sure my baseline of notifications has a high average of usefulness. This is hard to measure. A good quick test is maybe if notification center is a useful place to me, or not. I tinker with the baseline <em>before</em> I’m even introducing new focus modes (which add extra complexity).</p>\n<h3 id=\"usefocusmodessparingly\">Use focus modes sparingly</h3>\n<p>I currently have the following focus modes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>“Sleep” - for the night</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“Work” - for working</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“Do Not Disturb” - for when I need to focus or can not be disturbed (except in extraordinary circumstances).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I recently published a post about my <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/05/15/my-microcasts.html\">microcasts</a> and I‘m now writing this to tell you I’m going to microcast less. Less frequent and less scheduled. This is even weirder because I just created an intricate shortcut that automatically publishes a post with the right episode title and number without having to look up any of those details, which streamlined the entire process a lot.</p>\n\n<p>But I have noticed that I‘m not as much in the mood at the moment to record my thoughts in this way. <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/categories/the-early-riser/\">The early riser project</a>, for example, was a great McGuffin to get me out of bed, but since I have changed my approach to waking up, it has become less important to me. I don‘t want to record these little episodes for the ramblings alone.</p>\n\n<p>Being a big fan of podcasts like <a href=\"https://www.backtowork.limo\">Back To Work</a> and <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/cortex\">Cortex</a>, I thought I could do a microcast about my work and how I approach it, but I have noticed that I would like to write about these things, not only talk about them extemporaenously. LeadDev is also the microcast for which the ratio of recorded/published episodes is the worst: I take this as an indicator of my wanting to express myself more carefully than I can while walking the dog and having to observe the environment.</p>\n\n<p>À propos the dog: I created my first microcast, the PuppyCast, because I wanted to have a record of the challenges and joys of raising a puppy. I wanted to look (<a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/categories/dailydogo/\">DailyDoogo</a>, which I will not abandon, btw.) and listen back to this important time in my life. But I think that this project has run its course: I don‘t feel the need to publish this every week anymore. It‘s not like nothing changes or that there is nothing to report dog-wise, but it all comes down to the need to simplify and de-schedule my life. And I have episodes for the first six months, which seems like a good place to stop.</p>\n\n<p>Seasons change. And this is how I feel about my microcasting: Right now I‘d much rather write than talk. Looking at my blog I mostly see noise that was produced hastily to satisfy a self-imposed schedule. I will let this stuff go, for now.</p>\n",

Open the terminal\n2. Install rdfind with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) if you haven't done so already: `brew install rdfind`\n3. Navigate to your backups folder: `cd ~/Dropbox/Apps/Obsidian\\ Backups`\n4. Run rdfind: `rdfind -makesymlinks true .`\n\nYou will get output looking similar to this:\n\n```\nrdfind -makesymlinks true .\nNow scanning \".\", found 2475 files.\nNow have 2475 files in total.\nRemoved 0 files due to nonunique device and inode.\nTotal size is 467948959 bytes or 446 MiB\nRemoved 13 files due to unique sizes from list. 2462 files left.\nNow eliminating candidates based on first bytes: removed 10 files from list. 2452 files left.\nNow eliminating candidates based on last bytes: removed 0 files from list. 2452 files left.\nNow eliminating candidates based on sha1 checksum: removed 2 files from list. 2450 files left.\nIt seems like you have 2450 files that are not unique\nTotally, 223 MiB can be reduced.\nNow making results file results.txt\nNow making symbolic links. creating \nMaking 1406 links.\n```\n\nThis can be run on regular intervals (once an hour or so) to deduplicate your backups.

				"content_text": "<p><a href=\"https://obsidian.md\">Obsidian</a> is a personal knowledge base and note taking app with a lot of flexibility and extensions that make it very powerful. If you like to <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/01/23/notes-on-notes.html\">take notes</a> and be in control of your data, then Obsidian might be the right fit.</p>\n<p>What makes Obsidian so valuable for me is that it allows me to consolidate a lot of things into one app. Like information about a project and its tasks. Reference materials about sociology and solutions to programming problems. Everything can be made to fit into Obsidian and thanks to its extensibility and configurability, the app can be adapted to my evolving needs over time.</p>\n<p>Most people point out that Obsidian is an app for people who like to <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/01/23/103518.html\">link their notes together</a>. If you rename a note in Obsidian, all the links to it will be renamed, too. Linking notes, so that they become chains and/or trees of notes unlocks emergent qualities that you wouldn’t be able to access without linking them.<a id=\"fnref:1\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"see footnote\" href=\"#fn:1\">[1]</a> It is also available as an iPhone app, that can do almost all the things that the Mac app can do. So you can take all your stuff with you as well.</p>\n<p>Obsidian might not be for you, because it might just be a little bit too much. But it might also just be the tool you were looking for. If you happen to have a tendency to react skeptically to overly hyped apps like this one: Ignore the knowledge graph visualization stuff<a id=\"fnref:2\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"see footnote\" href=\"#fn:2\">[2]</a> and also the personal knowledge base singularity talk and just try it out. Obsidian is great. Don’t let the sometimes overly boastful rhetoric in this space keep you from at least trying it.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\"><hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>For example: You will find notes that, taken together, inspire a new creative thought. You might also rediscover an old solution to a problem you currently have. Or you might notice a pattern in otherwise disparate information. <a class=\"reversefootnote\" title=\"return to article\" href=\"#fnref:1\"> ↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\">\n<p>I think that visualizing one’s notes <em>could</em> at some point be helpful for maintaining and refactoring, but we are not there, yet. <a class=\"reversefootnote\" title=\"return to article\" href=\"#fnref:2\"> ↩</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>In January I did a yearly Review and planning session, a thing I always try to do every year.</p>\n\n<p>This year I have the following goals and ideas which I'd like to try out:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Becoming an early riser - Status Quo: Big success! So much more time<sup><a href=\"#fn1-22434\" id=\"fnr1-22434\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> to do my projects. Se also my unter two minutes podcast <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/categories/the-early-riser/\">\"The Early Riser\"</a> that I record every single morning right after I have woken up.</li>\n<li>\"I will start\" - Explanation: Be the one who initiates communication, anticipate things to do before anybody has to bring them up - Status: Eh. Could be better, but I am not so bothered by this.</li>\n<li>Evidence-based living - Explanation: <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/01/19/080216.html\">Track things</a> and find metrics to make more informed decisions about different areas in my life.</li>\n<li>\"Commit\" - Explanation: Inspired by <a href=\"https://www.oliverburkeman.com/books\">4000 Weeks</a>, I'll try to commit to only three work-in-progress items at a time and if I'm committed try to bring those things to an end that is satisfactory while also resisting other demands - internally or externally - on me and my time and attention. Status: Okay, actually.</li>\n<li>\"Read and Write more\" - Status: Meh. I am trying, though. I found that playing around with <a href=\"https://readwise.io\">Readwise</a><sup><a href=\"#fn2-22434\" id=\"fnr2-22434\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> has motivated me to do more in this regard.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-22434\">\n<p>A day has only 24 Hours, so how is changing the start of the day making a difference? It's all about not snoozing and using time in bed effectively. If you need 10 hours in bed to get 6 hours of sleep that's not very effective. On the other hand: If you sleep 7 hours while laying in bed for 8 that's pretty good. Changing my sleep schedule made me a more effective sleeper. <a href=\"#fnr1-22434\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn2-22434\">\n<p>I can't decide if it's a great thing or overpriced, yet. [EDIT: <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/02/13/my-current-highlighting.html\">I have decided that I like it. A lot.</a>] But I have noticed the little boost of interest of doing more reading (and re-reading) with every resurfaced highlight. So maybe it'll end up being worth it. <a href=\"#fnr2-22434\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

				"title": "Good Apps - Due",
				"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://www.dueapp.com/index.html\">Due</a> is a wonderful reminders and timers app for the Mac and iPhone/iPad that syncs via iCloud. Due has been around for ages (maybe a decade?) and it is still a great app that gives me a lot of functionality.</p>\n<p>What makes Due so special is twofold: Firstly if a reminder is due in Due it is annoyingly persistent. This means that you won&rsquo;t ignore the reminder ever which is great. Secondly Due has a great snooze system which allows you to quickly postpone a Due reminder to a later time. Taken together these two features mean, that you won&rsquo;t mark reminders completed that aren&rsquo;t really completed and you won&rsquo;t ignore the nudge that an overdue reminder gives you. It narrows down your options to: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to do this now!&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to this later. I imagine I will do it at this time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Due is great for things that wouldn&rsquo;t fit well on a calendar or would clog it up. It&rsquo;s great for repeating tasks that need to be done on a specific time but don&rsquo;t have a clear duration (feeding the dog at specific times a day, for example). It&rsquo;s great for one-offs as well, where you want to or need to do something later but might forget about it. Due has some natural language parsing built-in so creating new reminders or snoozing them is easy and fast. Due has shortcuts integration, too. It&rsquo;s a surprisingly versatile app.</p>\n<p>One other thing I love is its subscription model.

				"content_text": "[Due](https://www.dueapp.com/index.html) is a wonderful reminders and timers app for the Mac and iPhone/iPad that syncs via iCloud. Due has been around for ages (maybe a decade?) and it is still a great app that gives me a lot of functionality.\n\nWhat makes Due so special is twofold: Firstly if a reminder is due in Due it is annoyingly persistent. This means that you won't ignore the reminder ever which is great. Secondly Due has a great snooze system which allows you to quickly postpone a Due reminder to a later time. Taken together these two features mean, that you won't mark reminders completed that aren't really completed and you won't ignore the nudge that an overdue reminder gives you. It narrows down your options to: \"I'm going to do this now!\" or \"I'm going to this later. I imagine I will do it at this time.\"\n\nDue is great for things that wouldn't fit well on a calendar or would clog it up. It's great for repeating tasks that need to be done on a specific time but don't have a clear duration (feeding the dog at specific times a day, for example). It's great for one-offs as well, where you want to or need to do something later but might forget about it. Due has some natural language parsing built-in so creating new reminders or snoozing them is easy and fast. Due has shortcuts integration, too. It's a surprisingly versatile app.\n\nOne other thing I love is its subscription model. Before you throw your hands up, read these paragraphs:\n\n>When your year of free feature upgrades is up, you get to keep every feature that you already have access to, and you’ll continue to receive free app updates for as long as I’m in business.\n\n>You’ll also start seeing features that you have no access to.

One of my absolute faves. Please give it a try if you haven't already. And if you had done so in the past: maybe give it another try. Due has only gotten better over the years.\n",

When Hugo is done, syntax highlighting should now be working as intended and the code be legible.\n\nExample:\n\n```go-html-template\n{{ define \"main\" }}\n<div class=\"home h-feed\">\n  <ul class=\"post-list\">\n  {{ $paginator := .Paginate (where (where .Site.RegularPages.ByDate.Reverse \"Type\" \"post\") \"Params.title\" \"!=\" nil   ) (index .Site.Params \"archive-paginate\" | default 25) }}\n  {{ range $paginator.Pages  }}\n      <li class=\"h-entry\">\n\t\t\t<h1><a href=\"{{ .Permalink }}\">{{ .Title }}</a></h1>\n\n        <a href=\"{{ .Permalink }}\" class=\"u-url\"><span class=\"post-meta\"><time class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"{{ .Date.Format \"2006-01-02 15:04:05 -0700\" }}\">{{ .Date.Format \"Jan 2, 2006\" }}</time></span></a>\n\n        <div class=\"e-content\">\n         \t{{ .Content }}\n        </div>\n      </li>\n    {{ end }}\n  </ul>\n\n  <p class=\"rss-subscribe\">subscribe <a href=\"{{ \"feed.xml\" | absURL }}\">via RSS</a></p>\n\n</div>\n{{ end }}\n```\n\n\n~~[^1]: I'm not sure if this is all necessary or even the right way to go about it. It seems pretty involved and I don't even know how you would migrate your customizations in an easy way if you happen to have used the old style of choosing a theme… but this way works, that much I could prove.~~\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I barely can watch movies anymore. This has less to do with problems of changing aesthetics and me being unable to adapt (, although maybe a little bit). It’s more about it getting harder and harder to suspend my disbelief. An example from last night: I tried to watch „Don’t look up“ but got so infuriated by the depiction of how things would supposedly work, that I couldn’t enjoy an otherwise interesting idea. I guess I just don’t like when a movie’s plotting is dependent on unrealistic premises, especially when it claims to start from a place of (somewhat heightened) realism. Things should make sense within the confines of its world. If our actual world builds the backbone of the movie’s world then you gotta show the work that’s happening why things are different than we normally would expect them to be. Show me the work. This is not the same as asking for everything to be explained. I am simply asking for potential plausibility. Handwaving in the right spots is of course part of storytelling.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe it’s because I have studied history of science and technology, have been working in the literature studies department while I was studying and am now working as a programmer that I am therefore primed to notice and dislike such inconsistencies. I prefer nonfiction, memoirs and sociologically interesting sci-fi. Works that do not reduce the interesting complexities of our world to tell a story that doesn’t shy away from the effort to be plausible.</p>\n\n<p>I think that this happens to me more frequently now, is because I am much more time- and attention-constrained. I do not have the resources after a long day to consume too many things that ask me to do the work of „making it work“. I also have less chances to consume anything at all the older I get and the more responsibilities I have and am therefore more discerning on what I spend my time on. „Tried and true“ is often the answer. So no wonder that watching sports have become such a big part of my life instead of artistic works. I also prefer a solid but consistent tv show over an at times brilliant but otherwise disappointing one. I assess consuming media more and more from a standpoint of how risky it is: How likely will I be disappointed? I already have lists of lists of things I would like to do. If I decide to try something new, it better be worth it. And: It seldom is.</p>\n\n<p>There is a ratcheting effect built in this way of consuming media: You do more and more of the same and less and less of the new. If it was only me I would even prefer such a bias, but it also has consequences for enjoying things like movies and tv shows together with my partner. So I end up giving chances to things I would have not considered. Maybe that’s good. Things shouldn’t be too predictable either. But boy, do many, many things suffer from a lack of plausibility…</p>\n",

And I think this is universal and holds actually true for physical stuff as well.</p>\n<p>Given suitable conditions, the same demands will pop up in the physical world. Example: My partner works in a national park. In the customer service center of this park, they offer printed maps of the area for free. In other parks the same kind of maps cost money. Some People are upset by this state of affairs.<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>If this behavioral pattern is not confined to the web, the question then becomes a question of how to change the attitudes of people - given, that we want to problematize this observation. Can we? And more importantly: at what cost? This question is interesting to me, because I think it relates to my point about social problems being emergent properties, that I mentioned earlier.</p>\n<p>Attitudes and values are not one and the same. Values are part of the social and individuals might have an affirming or rejecting attitude towards those values. The way to get to an individual is through the social - you&rsquo;ll have to be social to interact. This means that to change an individual&rsquo;s attitude (or more efficient: make attitudes matter less) is a social problem - and, again, as I said in that other post: social problems are more social realities than problems, so changing attitudes can only be achieved by suppression<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">4</a></sup>. Suppressing anything - even for a moment in history - takes lots of maintenance. To make it last, you have to establish structures within the social. So this social question becomes cultural - if you want to make it last.</p>\n<p>I will stop here and ask, if the amount of resources needed to do this is worth it. And I&rsquo;ll answer that it is not. Akin to locks keeping honest people honest, the real task is to get more people who are sitting on the fence (or peeking over it) on the &ldquo;right&rdquo; (&ldquo;our&rdquo;) side. As far as I can tell the best &ldquo;above board&rdquo; way to do this is to communicate clearly what is free and what is not and give people varied options to buy what needs to be bought.<sup id=\"fnref:5\"><a href=\"#fn:5\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">5</a></sup> Giving reasons why to buy can help. Letting your personality shine through also helps.</p>\n<p>In short: People behaving entitled and demanding things for free is not tied to the web only. These behaviors are the result of undesirable attitudes that are too hard and too expensive to change sustainably. Therefore the real task is - apart from understanding the initial problem better - not changing the attitudes but to offer the people which are close to doing the right thing options to follow through and not worry about the rest.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>I want to thank Simon for giving me an opportunity to think out loud. This post took the above conversation as a starting point, but it is not an attempt to argue with Simon, show off, or troll. I just took our conversation and ran with it. So the &ldquo;you&rdquo; or the opposing voice in this post, does not refer to Simon. It does not presume that Simon hasn&rsquo;t thought about these things as well, etc. This post is meant as an exploration, not an agitation.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>This is mostly an argument of plausibility: I do not claim to know exactly what attitudes they hold, but I do claim that this line of thinking makes their behavior plausible, therefore possible, explainable, understandable.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:2\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:3\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>I will admit that I was a little upset, too: Because it was inconsistent and hard to anticipate what to expect. And I like to be able to anticipate what comes next. It&rsquo;s comforting, it makes me feel I&rsquo;m in control. This could be another plausible set of attitudes - as opposed to not believing that paying for stuff is important - of why people are behaving this way.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:3\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:4\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>I&rsquo;ll restate that suppression doesn&rsquo;t need to be a negative thing.

We don't have these expectations in the physical world and I've yet to see somebody justify how it is we change that for the web, you know?</p>\n<footer>Simon Woods <cite><a href=\"https://micro.blog/simonwoods/12010339\">https://micro.blog/simonwoods/12010339</a></cite></footer></blockquote><script src=\"https://micro.blog/quoteback.js\"></script>\n\nI was going to answer to this ongoing conversation within the thread but ran out of space and I thought it is interesting enough to warrant a titled post[^1]:\n\nSimon's observation is interesting to me because I think it relates to my point from the other day about [social problems being naturally occurring emergent properties of the social](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2021/09/30/problems-of-the.html).\n\nThe question of why do *some* people feel entitled to demand everything to be available for free on the web is, I think, mostly answered by the attitudes they hold[^2]: Is it important to you (to acknowledge that you ought to pay for stuff and/or be fine with not having stuff), or not? And I think this is universal and holds actually true for physical stuff as well.\n\nGiven suitable conditions, the same demands will pop up in the physical world. Example: My partner works in a national park. In the customer service center of this park, they offer printed maps of the area for free. In other parks the same kind of maps cost money. Some People are upset by this state of affairs.[^3]\n\nIf this behavioral pattern is not confined to the web, the question then becomes a question of how to change the attitudes of people - given, that we want to problematize this observation. Can we? And more importantly: at what cost? This question is interesting to me, because I think it relates to my point about social problems being emergent properties, that I mentioned earlier.\n\nAttitudes and values are not one and the same. Values are part of the social and individuals might have an affirming or rejecting attitude towards those values. The way to get to an individual is through the social - you'll have to be social to interact. This means that to change an individual's attitude (or more efficient: make attitudes matter less) is a social problem - and, again, as I said in that other post: social problems are more social realities than problems, so changing attitudes can only be achieved by suppression[^4]. Suppressing anything - even for a moment in history - takes lots of maintenance. To make it last, you have to establish structures within the social. So this social question becomes cultural - if you want to make it last.\n\nI will stop here and ask, if the amount of resources needed to do this is worth it. And I'll answer that it is not. Akin to locks keeping honest people honest, the real task is to get more people who are sitting on the fence (or peeking over it) on the \"right\" (\"our\") side. As far as I can tell the best \"above board\" way to do this is to communicate clearly what is free and what is not and give people varied options to buy what needs to be bought.[^5] Giving reasons why to buy can help. Letting your personality shine through also helps.\n\nIn short: People behaving entitled and demanding things for free is not tied to the web only. These behaviors are the result of undesirable attitudes that are too hard and too expensive to change sustainably. Therefore the real task is - apart from understanding the initial problem better - not changing the attitudes but to offer the people which are close to doing the right thing options to follow through and not worry about the rest.\n\n[^1]: I want to thank Simon for giving me an opportunity to think out loud. This post took the above conversation as a starting point, but it is not an attempt to argue with Simon, show off, or troll. I just took our conversation and ran with it. So the \"you\" or the opposing voice in this post, does not refer to Simon. It does not presume that Simon hasn't thought about these things as well, etc. This post is meant as an exploration, not an agitation.\n\n[^2]: This is mostly an argument of plausibility: I do not claim to know exactly what attitudes they hold, but I do claim that this line of thinking makes their behavior plausible, therefore possible, explainable, understandable.\n\n[^3]: I will admit that I was a little upset, too: Because it was inconsistent and hard to anticipate what to expect. And I like to be able to anticipate what comes next. It's comforting, it makes me feel I'm in control. This could be another plausible set of attitudes - as opposed to not believing that paying for stuff is important - of why people are behaving this way.\n\n[^4]: I'll restate that suppression doesn't need to be a negative thing. Think of it more like selective breeding.\n\n[^5]: I'm excluding dark patterns here, that exploit human nature to get the desired result. Instead of persuasion these patterns rely on seduction.\n",

You aren't so much \"fixing\" these problems, anyways: You suppress them (which isn't meant to suggest that that's always a bad thing). But suppression is work, takes infrastructure. The bigger the social structure you try to keep \"in order\" (like a gardener) the bigger the work. This is why suppression only works for self selected (or lucky), small groups with aligned interests and supporting structures (resources, established processes, a shared and actively maintained history<sup><a href=\"#fn2-8648\" id=\"fnr2-8648\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">2</a></sup>, …).

Didion is steeped in a way of life that I would guess only exists in its fossilized forms, in memories. The relatable topics and the now lost to us extravagance of old Hollywood produce a rich, deep and at times paradoxical memoir that I would especially recommend if you can spare the time to consume \"The Year Of Magical Thinking\" beforehand.\n",

To continue the theme, I recently listened to Joan Didion&rsquo;s Books: The Year of Magical Thinking and Let Me Tell You What I Mean.</p>\n<p>The Year of Magical Thinking is a memoir of an especially tumultuous year in her life. After the sudden death of her husband and the hospitalization of her daughter, Didion finds herself detached from reality and has to claw herself back to reason. There is a certain sharpness in the way she puts things, a certain breathlessness in the intelligence with which she follows the paths of her own thoughts while mourning the loss of a writing partner and spouse (a parallel to Hampl&rsquo;s book).</p>\n<p>We see here a woman who is smart, quick and in control of her faculties wanting to fight and having to accept, that there is no real shortcut, no swift way to skip the all too human need to just feel shitty for a while, to be scared, to be upset, to not know, to maybe not even understand why your own seemingly better argument, the pointed question or educated guess doesn&rsquo;t cut it. To be clear, what Didion focusses on is not this desire to skip the lowly emotions and loss of control that are part of the human condition. But, to me, she exemplifies how hard it is to accept the necessity of being a passenger, not the driver, for a while after an event like this.</p>\n<p>One strength of Didion&rsquo;s writing is that she can put a finger on the power of slightly changed emphases. Like in her text &ldquo;Everywoman.com&rdquo; about Martha Stewart and her empire from the second book of her&rsquo;s I have listened to: Let Me Tell You What I Mean, a collection of essays from 1968 to 2000.</p>\n<p>In Everywoman.com she turns the critique on Martha Stewart, a home maker turned CEO of a billion dollar company, inside out. The critique goes something like this: Martha Stewart is a fraud, because she pretends to be a simple homemaker, like her fans, even though in reality she is a driven business woman who created merely an artifice of being a homemaker. Didion is directing her more empathetic read of Stewart mainly against Jerry Oppenheimer&rsquo;s unauthorized investigative Book on her: Just Desserts. Opposed to Oppenheimer, Didion concludes that Stewart&rsquo;s success, Artifice and all, are inspirational to US-American women because Stewart managed to create her own rags to riches story: from homemaker to CEO.</p>\n<p>One thing I picked up and that is eerily related to her empathy for Stewart is her own success. I stumbled upon the following <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2XO43HUDM9UHF/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=1400078431\">review of The Year of Magical Thinking on Amazon</a> that is an example of what I mean:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>She certainly went through losses that would make anyone stagger.

She recounts good times in a long marriage that involves luxurious travels and freedom gained through wealth. Can&rsquo;t relate. Am I jealous? Probably.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Didion is well off, that much is clear. She has been a successful writer for a long time and coming up in a much more socially mobile era, she ended up being wealthy. The question is: Does this take away from her writing? And the answer is: Yes, a little bit. I wouldn&rsquo;t go so far to suggest that I can&rsquo;t relate or that what she has to say is not interesting, quiet the opposite, but because Didion&rsquo;s voice is one of careful reexamination (it reminds of the idiom &ldquo;show me, I&rsquo;m from Missouri&rdquo;) and her reputation is one of popularizing counter culture, of problematizing the American Dream I can&rsquo;t deny that the success, although earned, subverts a little bit her persona, her self-conception or the frame from which I read her (so maybe, probably, this is on me). It complicates the relationship between me, the reader (or listener in my case), and her, the counter culture writer. Now, I am not owed an uncomplicated relationship. But I do have to admit that the contrast of a now wealthy writer that came from a place of socially conscious reporting - and still has those instincts but lives a totally different life - lead to some cognitive dissonance. It totally makes sense that lives like this exist. She is not the first, nor the last that will have had also monetary success from writing empathetically about various social issues.

I don&rsquo;t think I knew this or could state this as plainly before this book. For a while I assumed it was weakness to be interested in this somewhat incomplete form - is that even the right word? - that is, autobiographical writing. But I love writing that leaves room for one&rsquo;s own thoughts. And I therefore loved this book which is a prime example of doing the form justice: The Art Of The Wasted Day by Patricia Hampl.</p>\n<p>It sounds like a straight up self-help book than it is. It is much more a beautiful mix of memoir and essay that circles around the topic of leisure and how it relates to writing, describing and living in general. What is great about these kinds of books is their way of heightening and compressing reality in its descriptions without loosing the connection to it. And so nothing is ever just the cause of anything or arranges itself neatly into a narrative ark. We might construe easy cause-and-effect relationships between the defining moments of our lives but at the same time we know - if we take the time to notice - that it is much more complex than that. Nowadays there is nothing more boring than a too neatly arranged story.</p>\n<p>While Hampl wrote this book, her husband died from a heart disease. Her longing to see him again, her struggles of not being able to believe - as a person being raised in the Catholic Faith no less - that there could actually be another side, where he would wait for her… I could feel that - as somebody raised devoid of any religion (Post-GDR east Berlin). I can imagine how this - having to realize that the partner you miss is gone for good, this person you spent most of your time with, the one which also happens to be your first reader - must have felt. This entanglement builds a lot of the emotional scaffolding in the book. I think it was pretty effective and lends the book a nice counterweight to Hampls beautifully written investigations of a leisurely life.</p>\n<p>I liked how history and especially her engagement with history writing made it possible to look over the author&rsquo;s shoulder while she discovers new wrinkles in the story of the Ladies of Llangollen - two Irish Women - who sought to live a &ldquo;life of retirement&rdquo; in the Welsh countryside in the 18th century - only to become famous for it. Montaigne is an important part of this book, too. He is her patron saint of description, observation and as the inventor of the essay an important corner stone of reflection. He is the poster child of the art of the wasted day. In another part of the book, she visits the almost forgotten but now famous proto-geneticist Gregor Mendel as well. He never managed to pass the exam to become a teacher. So he instead lived the life of a monk.</p>\n<p>Monks and Nuns are a big topic of the book. If not literally then figuratively, most of the people that are practicing the art of the wasted day are living a fairly structured life - an interesting paradox. But monastery life is not only structured but also slow. A structure followed slowly lends itself to being contemplative, to taking the time to observe and also describe. This kind of life, behind real or metaphorical walls might be a life lived in solitude (or: alone, but not lonely), is a life in which you are not needed all the time, not  interrupted constantly, a life where your input, your action is not demanded all the time, where you can come to rest on the <em>passing</em> within and around you, as Montaigne might have put it.</p>\n<p>The descriptions of her historical case studies are interwoven with her own life accounts. It&rsquo;s all the stuff I love about this form of writing: vignettes, reflections, beautiful descriptions. Like in the end, where she and her husband travel down the Mississippi river in an old wooden cabin boat, seeing her home state from a different angle and therefore very differently than ever before.</p>\n<p>The book also includes some well-reasoned advice. I loved her description of an anecdote in which a student of hers - she teaches writing at the University of Minnesota - didn&rsquo;t know what to write about himself, because he only came from Fridley (one of many the suburbs of Minneapolis):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I stared at him. I didn’t, for a moment, comprehend that this was the dark disclosure, this the occasion of his misery: being from Fridley meant, surely, that he had nothing to say. In effect, had no life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There it was again—nothin’ had ever happened to him and I was asking him to write about it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I have good news for you, Tommy,” I said. “The field’s wide open—nobody has told what it’s like to grow up in Fridley yet. It’s all yours.” (p. 185)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This passage was really eye-opening for me and put a finger on an important insight: Autobiographical writing doesn&rsquo;t need to be anchored by an exceptional life. Or rather: Any life can be made to be interesting.</p>\n<p>While writing this review I was googling around trying to find information about the book and its contents - I had listened to it through my local library - and I am a forgetful person. The book seemed to have gotten middling reviews in the aggregate. So I guess it&rsquo;s not a book for everyone and who knows if I would&rsquo;ve liked it as much, if I would&rsquo;ve read instead of listening to it. Parts of the magic of a book like this lie in the <em>sound</em> - and since Hampl reads this herself we really get an impression of the sound she was aiming for.</p>\n<p>For me it was an inspiring listen that made me write a lot more over the last three weeks and rediscover my love for memoirists writing like this.</p>\n<p>If you are interested to see if this is for you: There is <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2018/04/17/the-ladies-who-were-famous-for-wanting-to-be-left-alone/\">an excerpt about the Ladies of Llangollen on Longreads</a>.

I loved her description of an anecdote in which a student of hers - she teaches writing at the University of Minnesota - didn't know what to write about himself, because he only came from Fridley (one of many the suburbs of Minneapolis):\n\n>I stared at him. I didn’t, for a moment, comprehend that this was the dark disclosure, this the occasion of his misery: being from Fridley meant, surely, that he had nothing to say. In effect, had no life.\n\n>There it was again—nothin’ had ever happened to him and I was asking him to write about it.\n\n>“I have good news for you, Tommy,” I said. “The field’s wide open—nobody has told what it’s like to grow up in Fridley yet. It’s all yours.” (p. 185)\n\nThis passage was really eye-opening for me and put a finger on an important insight: Autobiographical writing doesn't need to be anchored by an exceptional life. Or rather: Any life can be made to be interesting.\n\nWhile writing this review I was googling around trying to find information about the book and its contents - I had listened to it through my local library - and I am a forgetful person. The book seemed to have gotten middling reviews in the aggregate. So I guess it's not a book for everyone and who knows if I would've liked it as much, if I would've read instead of listening to it. Parts of the magic of a book like this lie in the *sound* - and since Hampl reads this herself we really get an impression of the sound she was aiming for.\n\nFor me it was an inspiring listen that made me write a lot more over the last three weeks and rediscover my love for memoirists writing like this.\n\nIf you are interested to see if this is for you: There is [an excerpt about the Ladies of Llangollen on Longreads](https://longreads.com/2018/04/17/the-ladies-who-were-famous-for-wanting-to-be-left-alone/). And here is [a short clip](https://www.audiofilemagazine.com/reviews/read/140858/the-art-of-the-wasted-day-by-patricia-hampl-read-by-patricia-hampl/) of Hampl's performance of the beginning of the book's chapter entitled \"To Go\".\n",

				"content_html": "<p>When I was looking through my DayOne posts - the recent acquisition of the journaling app by automattic made me curious; I had not been using the app in a couple of years - I stumbled upon a journal entry that included a few screenshots of tweets that a quite popular German political Twitterer (maybe 30k followers back then, now around 50k followers) had posted, that berated me fiercely. How stupid I was and how dare I speak up against this person. They called me a baboon that needed to be put into place amongst other things. I think they called me sexist, too. I didn&rsquo;t have the heart to plunge deeper into the post. As I was simply too shocked. I had completely forgotten about this life altering experience half a decade ago. But here it was. And the remembering began.</p>\n<p>What had happened? When I was studying history of science and technology I was not shy to speak up. I was a young man that deemed himself smart and with a talent for research. I also had way too much time on my hands, which made me &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; in class. I read and studied furiously. And what I learned I wanted to apply. That is, nothing went past me in class. Any little uncertainty that came up, I problematized - to the frustration of my professors, I&rsquo;m sure, as well as my classmates. I wanted to be a researcher, or no, I wanted to be a prodigy. A person with great potential to become an exceptional researcher. I dreamt big. And I wanted my professors to see how smart I was. I had this dream that somebody would take me under their wing, make me behave, by offering a path to a career in research. I wanted to be tamed, I think, so that I could become the beautiful, creative researcher that I thought I ought to be.</p>\n<p>In any case, this phase of my life was a messy one and so were the discussions in the seminars. Lots of arguments, lots and lots of monologuing on my part. Oh, my poor classmates, forgive me! But that&rsquo;s who I was back then and although I look back with shame, I would be lying if I would not point out that this time of my life was one of the most instructive phases of it as well.</p>\n<p>I remember neither subject of the course nor the specific book introduction, chapter or article that we were assigned to read for this weeks class. What I do remember is that I disagreed vehemently with the author&rsquo;s premise that nobody had as of yet <em>really</em> looked into the topic at hand, except herself. That the author was female was incidental to my disagreement. But I never liked this take. To me, history was all about uncovering more and more aspects of the past. And a new take was adding a new shade, a new layer to the beautiful complexities of historiography as it related to the topic at hand. There is no singular fundamental take on history that subsumes all other takes - or at least not for long. History is best, I thought, if it was a humbling exercise, one in which your own strong opinions and values get somewhat relativized. History, to me, was a quest for authenticity, for serious inquiry, that ought not to bend to the political fashions of the day - even if I happen to agree with them. History ought to be historicist, in the German sense, where the understanding of a happening stems from a process of trying to find plausibility in the actions through sympathy for the actors - no matter how vile their behavior would be deemed, probably rightfully so, in our time. In short I was a young man looking for authenticity in a world full of ironic takes. I craved sincerity. &ldquo;Be real with me&rdquo;, I thought often, &ldquo;I want to like you&rdquo;. &ldquo;I want to be sure that you like me&rdquo;, if you say so, too. I was lonely and longed for reliability.</p>\n<p>It was well known amongst history of science students back then, that we had a minor celebrity in our midst. This person was a young politician of some clout. An up-and-comer that had gotten a taste of political authority, of respect towards their own person, after being elected to the city&rsquo;s parliament. They were invited to talk shows and interviewed a few times for TV and radio back then. They carried the aura of demanding respect into our classroom as well. Wearing nice long woolen coats, good fitting suits and expensive looking scarfs, not at all what the rest of us normals wore and especially not me, the wild man in the shabby cloths. They were standing out. They had understood that clothes make the person. At the same time their public persona was one of irony, of trolling for the greater good, or what they perceived as the greater good. They were a postmodern politician. One that always seemed to play both sides of the un/certainty coin: Claiming &ldquo;Facts first!&rdquo; but being crowned troll of the year some years earlier.</p>\n<p>The actual quarrel around which I have been circulating for this handful of paragraphs is explained quickly: My adversary had read the text different than me - or not differently, but more affirmatively. The claim of a fundamental take did not repel them, quite the opposite. They bought the author&rsquo;s points about what others had overlooked, maybe they bought the idea of a perfect all-encompassing historical take as well? I wasn&rsquo;t sure back then, but I was sure that history doesn&rsquo;t bend to a totalitarian approach. Writing history is a process of picking and choosing, of simplification. So I argued against their notion, vehemently. That the author had a feminist viewpoint - which was so incidental to my points - became the linchpin of the discussion. To this day I am sure of this: Even a struggle so central to modern societal progress as equality can only ever be an aspect of historiography. You may base a whole career on feminist history - and that would be an important pursuit - but nobody would claim everything is said and done when we have told all there is to tell about this struggle. No. No! And again: No!</p>\n<p>I would like to claim that I stayed as calm as I am now, writing all this down however many years later, but that would be a lie. We shouted at each other. I didn&rsquo;t permit this person, or my professor for that matter, to have the last word. I was incapable to give in, to allow this person to lug his intimidating aura around to steamroll me. After all, this was academia! Or its impoverished simulacrum at least. And arguments ought to count more than any accomplishments in other arenas of society here. Finally, the person just left in the middle of the class, infuriated, slamming the door. I was about to make another remark about their bad attitude, but was silenced by my professor: &ldquo;Martin!&rdquo; He only shouted this one word. My name. &ldquo;Martin!&rdquo; &ldquo;There it was&rdquo;, I thought. Finally an acknowledgement. I felt oddly good. I felt put into place. And wasn&rsquo;t this what I wanted? To be put into place?</p>\n<p>A few hours later, still pumped up from the altercation, I learned that my opponent had posted the tweets they did. I don&rsquo;t think they assumed that I was a Twitter user or would seek ought their timeline - if they cared at all. I found myself in an exceptional situation: I could read what another person that didn&rsquo;t like me thought about me. They just had put it out there for anyone to read. That included me and their kinda big audience. Some people liked those tweets, others retweeted them. And even though I knew, intellectually, that these tweets weren&rsquo;t meant for me or were in the end about me, really (they were about this persons anger), I felt deeply hurt. I felt seen, in a bad way. I felt revealed, caught. I felt like I was laughable. The whole village, <em>their</em> village, had it out for me, pointing, be it in anger or amusement about this anti-feminist idiot, who came to town, unbidden, to insult the mayor with his retrograde ideas, the fool, not even able to see how antiprogressive he is. I felt my artifice was visible as such. The political ascriptions didn&rsquo;t bother me, because they weren&rsquo;t accurate. But the persona that was described between the lines did. This mess of piled up insecurities that held up the disguise of an eager student was laid bare. There I was, in my most unfavorable interpretation. However, I couldn&rsquo;t deny the fact that it was a possible interpretation. It had a connection to reality. Yes, I was a self-serious jerk. And I knew it, I realized it, sometimes. And in this moment, I could see it clearly, I wasn&rsquo;t the only one who was aware. I felt deeply ashamed.</p>\n<p>As though a pill as it is swallow to remember all of this, to rethink all of this: I am grateful that I had the strength back then to screenshot those tweets and put them into my journal. I don&rsquo;t know if I knew it back then, but I preserved a seminal moment in my life. There is no real moral here. And I couldn&rsquo;t point to this vignette as the cause for things being different from there on out. I carried on a couple of years longer with this prodigy-jerk persona, before it finally clicked that this wasn&rsquo;t the way. Erosion takes its time.
