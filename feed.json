If I can't do what's on the list for the day without overwhelm, I will remove items until it has become manageable again).\n\n**_I am going to continue to write in private, incorporating my love for the abstract and trying to develop ideas and coming up with ways to live the small, slow life in a world that is on fire and probably will stay on fire for the rest of my lifetime._**\n\nI will try to embrace to do less things at work, too.\n\n- I am not going to see every opportunity for change in the company in general as a must-participate for me.\n- I am not going to let technical purity concerns block me from doing a good job.\n- I am not going to say yes per default to every challenge to my estimations and ways in which I'm going to approach the task at hand either.\n- I am not going to react immediately to any and every message in my work chat.\n- I am not going to ignore my scheduled time blocks to do focussed work or anything else I had planned.\n\n**_I am going to try to hone my craft, with an eye for quality, architecture and pragmatic professionalism. I am going to take advantage of the 4 hours per week that I am supposed to be able to use for learning and growing as a programmer._**\n",

My reflex is to say: Not much. Intentions are a lag measure. That doesn't mean we shouldn't support what we think is important to create the world we want to live in - even if it's only for our own sakes - and support the people and actions the seem to us necessary to make these things more likely, but I do think this stuff is merely necessary but not sufficient to change the course of the world at large.

Social media is a seductive medium. I was tired and it was easy to fire off a reply like the one I did. It felt righteous.</p>\n<p>Now, I had written very recently about my interest to not play this &ldquo;moral purity&rdquo;-based game anymore (not that I ever really played it, but that is besides the point), in which we proclaim a certain world view or stance as morally superior, avant-garde or whatever and start to judge what&rsquo;s happening in the world. My point with this was and is that we ought to construct and view - or at least make possible to trace - the complex network that makes up the state of any (local) reality in our moment in time. I want less reductionist views (although I freely admit that heuristics and simplifications and abstractions are important actors in a text and are not to be ignored either) and more connective tissue between manifesto-like expressions and details and steps on how to actually scale that for the planet or even <em>manifest it</em> just for my local reality, here and now. I am a skeptical person and am always a little suspicious, if people proclaim stuff like &ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t use AI!&rdquo;, &ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t fly!&rdquo;, etc. because all this doesn&rsquo;t make sense if for example - I speak for myself - AI is helping me paper over gaps in my programming knowledge. I am dependent on the job I have so I better have some understanding of how to use this technology. When my boss says &ldquo;your estimate is too high, ask ChatGPT how to do this and you&rsquo;ll be quicker…&rdquo; I of course have a thousand counter arguments in my mind but in the end I am not studying philosophy, management theory, or whatever. I am employed as a programmer and am expected to do my work in a way that is (seemingly) most efficient. And I have to admit that AI <em>is</em> actually helping me, too. I think. It&rsquo;s in any case an interesting technology that I should know how to use if I am to engage in meaningful discourse about it. So much so, that I am using these tools also in my free time here and there. I also happen to have family in Germany and am living in Finland. Therefore I <em>will</em> fly more often than others (at least twice a year, probably) to see my family members.</p>\n<p>So I think I am allowed to say that <em>I get it</em>. I get the need and the want to express something more complex than &ldquo;Good is defined as X, you&rsquo;re not X therefore you&rsquo;re not good.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>However, taking on more complexity when doing a take, does still not excuse you from also recognizing power structures. Many people are outraged over OpenAI&rsquo;s handling of a voice very similar to one that sounds like Scarlett Johansson&rsquo;s. I am not very hopeful that an investigation would ever conclusively show that OpenAI just cloned her voice or didn&rsquo;t employ a voice actor that sounds similar to her <em>because</em> that person had a voice similar to Johansson&rsquo;s. But it seems questionable to not assume some form recklessness or even ill-intent here.</p>\n<p>People who have the bandwidth for it are worried and annoyed by tech bros and Big Tech. And often for good reasons. It&rsquo;s not like there is no evidence. They feel violated by them being invasive and exploitative. This is where most manifestos in this space come from, I bet. So a case like this - which to most people who can stomach engaging with this part of the AI hype is just another in a growing list - is to be taken seriously as a prime example of what people despise about companies behind AI.</p>\n<p>I am angry about posts like the one I replied to, because it gives more complex, maybe more subtle view points a bad reputation. I do not believe that more complex takes are created equal. But it can look that way sometimes, which is why complexity has become a watch word and moral purity so attractive. &ldquo;Both-side-sing&rdquo; is a terrible excuse for a careful, nuanced take, though.</p>\n",

I get the need and the want to express something more complex than \"Good is defined as X, you're not X therefore you're not good.\"\n\nHowever, taking on more complexity when doing a take, does still not excuse you from also recognizing power structures. Many people are outraged over OpenAI's handling of a voice very similar to one that sounds like Scarlett Johansson's. I am not very hopeful that an investigation would ever conclusively show that OpenAI just cloned her voice or didn't employ a voice actor that sounds similar to her _because_ that person had a voice similar to Johansson's. But it seems questionable to not assume some form recklessness or even ill-intent here.\n\nPeople who have the bandwidth for it are worried and annoyed by tech bros and Big Tech. And often for good reasons. It's not like there is no evidence. They feel violated by them being invasive and exploitative. This is where most manifestos in this space come from, I bet. So a case like this - which to most people who can stomach engaging with this part of the AI hype is just another in a growing list - is to be taken seriously as a prime example of what people despise about companies behind AI.\n\nI am angry about posts like the one I replied to, because it gives more complex, maybe more subtle view points a bad reputation. I do not believe that more complex takes are created equal. But it can look that way sometimes, which is why complexity has become a watch word and moral purity so attractive. \"Both-side-sing\" is a terrible excuse for a careful, nuanced take, though.\n",

And for you personally, efficiency gains may do exactly that. But collectively, efficiency seems to have the opposite effect As technology gets more efficient, we tend to consume more resources. This backfire effect is known as the ‘Jevons paradox’, and it occurs for a simple reason. At a social level, efficiency is not a tool for conservation; it’s a catalyst for technological sprawl.1</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Here’s how it works. As technology gets more efficient, it cheapens the service that it provides. And when services get cheaper, we tend to use more of them. Hence, efficiency ends up catalyzing greater consumption.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Take the evolution of computers as an example. The first computers were room-sized machines that gulped power while doing snail-paced calculations.

Change is impossible to envision. Especially if imagined as collective change on a planetary scale. Things will have to become <em>much</em> worse before we can meaningfully engage with what happens. Maybe this is not <em>you</em>, but it is us. You can warn and write all the manifestos you want, have a negative footprint or whatever: Just as with AI we&rsquo;ll have to come to terms with the fact that climate change is just us. We&rsquo;re the planet. And as the planet is the result and the cause of what&rsquo;s going on, the individual will have to recognize and come to terms with not being able to do a lot.</p>\n<p>There is hope in disruption. But strategically &ldquo;weaponized&rdquo; disruption (like calculated, non-violent <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/05/18/weblogpomo-a-rational.html\">protest</a>) can only do so much and it seems that big economic players like Big Tech™ to name an example are not even playing within the margins of democracy any more. Take this quote from <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/05/big-tech-eu-drop-dead\">a recent Cory Doctrow article</a> on the EU&rsquo;s attempt to regulate tech giants via the DMA:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Apple appears to be playing a high-stakes game of chicken with EU regulators, effectively saying, “Yes, you have 500 million citizens, but we have three trillion dollars, so why should we listen to you?” […] Just like Apple, Meta is behaving as though the DMA permits it to carry on its worst behavior, with minor cosmetic tweaks around the margins. Just like Apple, Meta is daring the EU to enforce its democratically enacted laws, implicitly promising to pit its billions against Europe’s institutions to preserve its right to spy on us. […] Tech has found new ways to compromise our privacy rights, our labor rights, and our consumer rights - at scale. […] After decades of regulatory indifference to tech monopolization, competition authorities all over the world are taking on Big Tech. The DMA is by far the most muscular and ambitious salvo we’ve seen. […] Seen in that light, it’s no surprise that Big Tech is refusing to comply with the rules. If the EU successfully forces tech to play fair, it will serve as a starting gun for a global race to the top, in which tech’s ill-gotten gains - of data, power and money - will be returned to the users and workers from whom that treasure came.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even if the DMA will be enforced completely and the EU won&rsquo;t let big companies weasel out of actually complying, I have very little hope that this game of resisting compliance and enacting policies is not continuing for the foreseeable future. Non compliance is surely not a phenomenon exclusive to Big Tech. Far from it. Which means that even if we get the right people to put policies into place to reign in companies this cat and mouse game is just going to make sure that climate change is even more of a sure thing.</p>\n<p>And what about all of the non-democratic societies?

A couple of things form this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Joe Biden is about to slap 100% tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles. A 100% tariff is an absolutely huge tariff. It means that Chinese EV makers would have to sell their EVs in the U.S. at half the price of EVs manufactured elsewhere in order to be competitive. That just isn’t going to happen. A 100% tariff will probably be enough to keep essentially all made-in-China EVs out of the U.S.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And further, himself quoting David Fickling:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A lot of people are worried that tariffs like these will slow down the transition to a low-carbon future powered by solar power and batteries. For example, David Fickling writes:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>China’s widening lead in clean technology, coupled with its vast trade surplus…are combining with faltering efforts on decarbonization in developed countries to produce a toxic mix…If green technology such as electric vehicles…gets badged as foreign and threatening and finds itself excluded via…tariff policies, then drastically falling costs aren’t going to be enough to get it into the hands of consumers…An acceleration in trade wars will only slow our path to zero [carbon].</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He’s right to worry. Transportation is responsible for almost 30% of U.S. carbon emissions, or about 4% of the global total. If the U.S. failed to switch to EVs, it could hamper decarbonization efforts by a small but noticeable amount.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And a last one from this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The most important thing about these tariffs is probably the message they send. Protectionism is now the consensus economic policy of both major political parties in the United States. Biden has extended the Trump tariffs on China and levied the new EV tariffs; Trump is trying to one-up Biden by promising to raise the 100% tariffs to 200%, extend them to Mexico, and slap an additional 60% tariff on all Chinese-made goods. There is currently no major party or presidential candidate that you can vote for in America that is even remotely interested in free trade.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What I take from this is that the biggest economies are at a trade war with each other and it&rsquo;s about to get very ideological on planet earth again(?) - but not in an environmentally friendly ideological way we might hope for.

				"content_html": "<p>Having agreed to write more this month has produced a handful of posts that make me uncomfortable.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/05/13/weblogpomo-thoughts-on.html\">A Post about my gripes with exclusionary &ldquo;Manifestos&rdquo; that seem to mistake moral purity for a self selected avant-garde with carefully trying to integrate new actors like LLMs in our lives</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/05/14/weblogpomo-vulnerable-thoughts.html\">A Post about my thoughts around LLMs that boils down to LLMs are here to stay, so we need actors that are interested in social justice, nature conservation, and so on to actively engage these things, to shape their future instead of turning away.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/05/16/weblogpomo-ist-there.html\">A Post about my doubts that the web is a society and therefore non-violent internet protests can work.</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are all posts that make me uncomfortable because these are fluent thoughts that get more concrete the more I write. Today I wanted to add another point about (non-violent) protest.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve spent enough time in the social humanities, you will end up with a viewpoint that could be condensed down to &ldquo;humans are gonna human&rdquo;, meaning that intentional action very seldomly can be used as a starting point for analysis because either it is not visible to the observer, or intentions are getting displaced as soon as other actors are entangled. If that is true and it still seems possible to give good descriptions, maybe even explanations of change over time, of &ldquo;why the things are the way they are&rdquo; by completely excluding intentionality from the analysis, then it seems right to be very skeptical towards explanations that rely on private intentions being present to make sense of the world. You don&rsquo;t need to know the why of individuals to understand the why (or at least give a convincing description of the state of things at a given time) in a larger sense.</p>\n<p>Armed with this viewpoint it seems heartbreakingly obvious that protest can&rsquo;t work, because bigger more distributed powers shape society, if you like it or not.</p>\n<p>But. There is a case to be made for protest, if we don&rsquo;t assume protesting is meant to inform and convince the wider public to change their ways and join the protesters until the social pressure becomes so high that other people would be elected to the parliament that in turn would enact new policies.</p>\n<p>If we take as read that any protest would need enough active participants and sympathizers, why would you want to protest if not for convincing people? I found this great encapsulation in a <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40379879\">Hacker News thread</a> about the 3,5% rule:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Protests aren&rsquo;t intended to gain allies. It&rsquo;s to put pressure on those in charge. Pissing people off and interrupting commerce is literally the point.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Disruption is the point! It means that people will complain about the protestors. It means that the politicians in charge will be asked - sooner or later - to deal with the protestors and in its absolute form this can really only go three ways: 1.) The wish of the protestors is granted in some way or 2.) the state uses violence to end the protests. Either way the non-violent protestors keep the moral high ground. 3.) The third option is that the protest peters out, in which case the protest was not strong enough to begin with and not worth a potential conflict with the law. You really have to believe in what you believe (or at least make other people believe that you believe in what they believe) to spearhead a protest.</p>\n<p>So there you have it: A rational case for protest is about disruption not about convincing fellow citizens. You need allies to make enough of a fuss, but changing society has a lot less to do with convincing people and a lot more to do with strategically annoy them.</p>\n<p>What has this to do with not taking intentionalities into account? We can see that the mechanism of protest works even if people do not act strategically on purpose. All you need is the right strong convictions and the wish to disrupt people for disrespecting your values. If you as an individual realize that protest works like this or not is not important for it to work this way.</p>\n<p>So what about the other posts? I wonder if some problems in wanting to change the web through protest and activism can be attributed to there not being a need to understand the mechanism. You can disrupt parts of the web, but the web is not a society which means that platforms won&rsquo;t react in the same way - or at least they don&rsquo;t need to - because shutting down protests is so much easier: like <a href=\"https://m.benui.ca/@ben/112396505994216742\">what recently happened</a> on stack overflow:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Stack Overflow announced that they are partnering with OpenAI, so I tried to delete my highest-rated answers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Stack Overflow does not let you delete questions that have accepted answers and many upvotes because it would remove knowledge from the community.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So instead I changed my highest-rated answers to a protest message.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Within an hour mods had changed the questions back and suspended my account for 7 days.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The web is not a democratic society so disrupting a platform will have a different result than disrupting society: Either nothing happens, the platform dies or you get banned. Note that these things seem similar to what I wrote above, but they are different. One way in which these are different is that a platform is not owned by its users. Another way they are different is that people in charge are not elected by its users. So the dynamic of pissing of fellow citizens, them complaining to politicians to end the disruption and the politicians having to decide to either answer with ethically questionable violence or by granting the wish to the protesters is not working in the same way. Users engage on platforms. Platforms have owners. And these owners may have share holders to answer to but share holders are not congruent with the users of said platforms. To make protest work you would need a meaningful amount of users be part owners of a platform. Or you need to protest in the context of your society, which would be my point to make here.</p>\n",
				"content_text": "Having agreed to write more this month has produced a handful of posts that make me uncomfortable.\n\n- [A Post about my gripes with exclusionary \"Manifestos\" that seem to mistake moral purity for a self selected avant-garde with carefully trying to integrate new actors like LLMs in our lives](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/05/13/weblogpomo-thoughts-on.html)\n- [A Post about my thoughts around LLMs that boils down to LLMs are here to stay, so we need actors that are interested in social justice, nature conservation, and so on to actively engage these things, to shape their future instead of turning away.](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/05/14/weblogpomo-vulnerable-thoughts.html)\n- [A Post about my doubts that the web is a society and therefore non-violent internet protests can work.](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/05/16/weblogpomo-ist-there.html)\n\nThese are all posts that make me uncomfortable because these are fluent thoughts that get more concrete the more I write. Today I wanted to add another point about (non-violent) protest.\n\nIf you've spent enough time in the social humanities, you will end up with a viewpoint that could be condensed down to \"humans are gonna human\", meaning that intentional action very seldomly can be used as a starting point for analysis because either it is not visible to the observer, or intentions are getting displaced as soon as other actors are entangled. If that is true and it still seems possible to give good descriptions, maybe even explanations of change over time, of \"why the things are the way they are\" by completely excluding intentionality from the analysis, then it seems right to be very skeptical towards explanations that rely on private intentions being present to make sense of the world. You don't need to know the why of individuals to understand the why (or at least give a convincing description of the state of things at a given time) in a larger sense.\n\nArmed with this viewpoint it seems heartbreakingly obvious that protest can't work, because bigger more distributed powers shape society, if you like it or not.\n\nBut. There is a case to be made for protest, if we don't assume protesting is meant to inform and convince the wider public to change their ways and join the protesters until the social pressure becomes so high that other people would be elected to the parliament that in turn would enact new policies.\n\nIf we take as read that any protest would need enough active participants and sympathizers, why would you want to protest if not for convincing people? I found this great encapsulation in a [Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40379879) about the 3,5% rule:\n\n>Protests aren't intended to gain allies. It's to put pressure on those in charge. Pissing people off and interrupting commerce is literally the point.\n\nDisruption is the point! It means that people will complain about the protestors. It means that the politicians in charge will be asked - sooner or later - to deal with the protestors and in its absolute form this can really only go three ways: 1.) The wish of the protestors is granted in some way or 2.) the state uses violence to end the protests. Either way the non-violent protestors keep the moral high ground. 3.) The third option is that the protest peters out, in which case the protest was not strong enough to begin with and not worth a potential conflict with the law. You really have to believe in what you believe (or at least make other people believe that you believe in what they believe) to spearhead a protest.\n\nSo there you have it: A rational case for protest is about disruption not about convincing fellow citizens. You need allies to make enough of a fuss, but changing society has a lot less to do with convincing people and a lot more to do with strategically annoy them.\n\nWhat has this to do with not taking intentionalities into account? We can see that the mechanism of protest works even if people do not act strategically on purpose. All you need is the right strong convictions and the wish to disrupt people for disrespecting your values. If you as an individual realize that protest works like this or not is not important for it to work this way.\n\nSo what about the other posts? I wonder if some problems in wanting to change the web through protest and activism can be attributed to there not being a need to understand the mechanism. You can disrupt parts of the web, but the web is not a society which means that platforms won't react in the same way - or at least they don't need to - because shutting down protests is so much easier: like [what recently happened](https://m.benui.ca/@ben/112396505994216742) on stack overflow:\n\n>Stack Overflow announced that they are partnering with OpenAI, so I tried to delete my highest-rated answers.\n\n>Stack Overflow does not let you delete questions that have accepted answers and many upvotes because it would remove knowledge from the community.\n\n>So instead I changed my highest-rated answers to a protest message.\n\n>Within an hour mods had changed the questions back and suspended my account for 7 days.\n\nThe web is not a democratic society so disrupting a platform will have a different result than disrupting society: Either nothing happens, the platform dies or you get banned.

				"content_html": "<p>It makes me extremely uncomfortable to think in terms of ethics when it comes to generative AI. I would like to say that <a href=\"https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2024/you-should-not-be-using-llms/\">I am agreeing with Baldur Bjarnason on the matter</a> and that there is actually nothing to discuss, but only to state that AI is unethical, unsustainable, un-researched and actively harmful to the planet and its inhabitants. It&rsquo;s also a <a href=\"https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2024/the-unsustainability-of-the-ai-bubble/\">bubble</a> and can&rsquo;t deliver on its promise:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Found via a Reddit post about a WSJ article quoting a Sequioa presentation</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In a presentation earlier this month, the venture-capital firm Sequoia estimated that the AI industry spent $50 billion on the Nvidia chips used to train advanced AI models last year, but brought in only $3 billion in revenue.\nThis 17x number is just for chips – Nvidia chips alone, I think – so the actual cost-to-revenue multiplier is much higher in reality.\nSo the hardware it’s installed in and the actual CPUs are extra. Research is extra. The army of freelancers used for RLHF training are extra. Electricity cost is extra.\nAnd chips depreciate in value pretty rapidly. Especially since every chip vendor on the planet has more specialised ML chips in the pipeline that are more effective at the task. This investment will be worthless pretty quickly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But then … I am using it at work - where my employers pay for a pro version for us to use - and even in my free time I use it as my access to a more advanced version makes it more interesting to use and I&rsquo;m - as I am so often - caught up in a kind of fatalist argument, it seems: I do not see LLMs going away. Do I feel better for not using them? Only theoretically. I feel like I am learning things while I use them because there are actually wast swaths of what I am theoretically supposed to to be able to do at work that I can&rsquo;t do without a nudge here and there. Same is true in recreational programming.</p>\n<p>In theory I feel that keeping myself morally untouchable and staying &ldquo;pure&rdquo; is interesting, but just as I tried to express <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/05/13/weblogpomo-thoughts-on.html\">when I was talking about manifestos</a> and their harsh delineation between good and bad according to a standard they define without outlining the practical steps to make this a reality, I find myself reaching for the same here: Purity is theoretically interesting, but practically life happens elsewhere and so it is more a question of degree, if anything.</p>\n<p>I can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t deny the fact that I find these AI tools helpful and interesting, sometimes. I won&rsquo;t not agree either that they are also not unproblematic. However, I will say that excluding these things from your life - by individual consumer choice - doesn&rsquo;t do anything to make them do less harm, make them more sustainable or actually changing the practicalities of life. We have become very good at defining things in such an &ldquo;either/or&rdquo; way that it has become useless to apply these standards to any real life situation, where you may be forced, coerced or seduced into - for example - using these things. What now? Time to stop living? Time to apologize for the rest of your life? I think that we may have to relearn how to examine the world. Not in terms of purity of our actions, but in terms of the realization of the world we inhabit.</p>\n<p>This means manny big and small things. One small thing it means is to understand the relative limit any one&rsquo;s actions have on the whole. We are an expression of the whole, so not being able to change the whole is not THAT surprising, I&rsquo;d say. This also means that better understanding the whole - for example by examining the insane amounts of money and resources that are put into training, developing and serving these models to customers (like in the quote above) and how insanely powerless we as individuals are to change this - helps understanding us and our place int this world. Look, even in Europe - which I would only call a beacon of democracy by comparison to the alternatives out there - I do not foresee a sufficiently strict policy that would make LLMs impossible to deploy even though they are, in their current state, unethical in so many ways.</p>\n<p>But if this is the case … I think you ought to be able to examine what you&rsquo;re dealing with. I think people found always interesting what is problematic in one way or another. As far as I can tell LLMs and the whole field of commercial AI are no different. Does this give you card blanche to not care about any and all concerns around this? No. Does this mean you can&rsquo;t use those tools? I don&rsquo;t know, I tend to think the answer is no here, too.</p>\n<p>There are things that are tabus in society that you definitely, positively cannot find good and explore in the way I try to argue for here. You can&rsquo;t try on &ldquo;slavery&rdquo; or &ldquo;naziism&rdquo; for size, for example. But LLMs are not a tabu. They are problematic, sure, but they are not the same thing as those societal tabus. They may become one, we&rsquo;ll see. It follows that you may be interested in them as long as you stay mindful and open to what they may become. I would even say that it is important to stay engaged, because this also makes it possible to recognize what may be worth developing further.</p>\n<p>I guess what I&rsquo;m trying to argue for is: 1. LLMs are going to stick around. They may not fulfill their promise of becoming super intelligent conscious agents  - which is pretty unlikely and in any case prohibitively expensive and ruinous to our planet - but they are here to stay in some form or fashion. 2. Being interested in and using LLMs - even in your day to day life - won&rsquo;t change this, however it well give you a better idea of what LLMs are and what they can and can&rsquo;t do in an experiential sort of way that will absolutely change your perception of them. It&rsquo;s not wrong to be curious as long as you&rsquo;re cautious and recognize that you can&rsquo;t generalize your experience: You&rsquo;re not doing publishable research, you&rsquo;re finding out for yourself. 3. I find it MUCH more valuable to live in the uncomfortable truth that you as an &ldquo;unpure&rdquo; individual can only do so much, apart from being interested in what is going on and actually recognize and examine what makes existence so uncomfortable if you can&rsquo;t change what&rsquo;s happening, which is kind of contradictoriy. I want people to express this ambivalence and live in it, because most of us are simply unable to live purely for purity&rsquo;s sake.</p>\n",

I mostly wanted to point to some lines from Bruno Latour and his 2010 paper <a href=\"http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/120-NLH-finalpdf.pdf\">An Attempt at a &ldquo;Compositionist&rdquo; Manifesto</a> and comment on their implication for the Humane Web Manifesto, as far as I am interested in it here:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I know full well that, just like the time of avant-gardes or that of the Great Frontier, the time of manifestos has long passed. Actually, it is the time of time that has passed: this strange idea of a vast army moving forward, preceded by the most daring innovators and thinkers, followed by a mass of slower and heavier crowds, while the rearguard of the most archaic, the most primitive, the most reactionary people trails behind[…]. During this recently defunct time of time, manifestos were like so many war cries intended to speed up the movement, ridicule the Philistines, castigate the reactionaries. This huge warlike narrative was predicated on the idea that the flow of time had one—and only one—inevitable and irreversible direction. The war waged by the avant-gardes would be won, no matter how many defeats they suffered. What this series of manifestos pointed to was the inevitable march of progress. So much so that these manifestos could be used like so many signposts to decide who was more “progressive” and who was more “reactionary.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And even though I love this text for it is a pretty good one, I will stop quoting after one more passage:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And yet a manifesto might not be so useless at this point, making explicit (that is, manifest) a subtle but radical transformation in the definition of what it means to progress, that is, to process forward and meet new prospects. Not as a war cry for an avant-garde to move even further and faster ahead, but rather as a warning, a call to attention, so as to stop going further in the same way as before toward the future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think that this understanding of what a manifesto could be in our modern world fits nicely to the way the web is going and how to proceed: Carefully and facing the future. With taking precautions and slowly. With an eye for a more &ldquo;ecologist&rdquo; web, that is with an eye for dependencies and conditions that make up diversity. I think this is a great framing for the humane web, because the categories used to frame this manifesto make clear what is needed for society of the web to make it in the wilderness that is the internet: &ldquo;accessible&rdquo;, &ldquo;inclusive&rdquo;, &ldquo;safe&rdquo;, &ldquo;secure&rdquo;, &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo;, &ldquo;reliable&rdquo;, &ldquo;resilient&rdquo;, &ldquo;transparent&rdquo;, &ldquo;independent&rdquo;, &ldquo;human-centred&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>I have some quibbles with some of the categories and especially coming from a Latourian actor-network perspective I find that using the term &ldquo;society&rdquo; (as in &ldquo;Like a functioning society, we take what we need, and we contribute what we can. We are citizens of the web…&quot;) would need to be qualified a little to make sure that we understand ourselves as makers being made by the web - which just means that tools have agency, too and that we have to lengthen our gaze a little past what we would traditionally call society. There is more involved.</p>\n<p>About those categories I will only note one more thing before trying to express what I would&rsquo;ve like to see more of. This point is that instead of &ldquo;independent&rdquo; I would have chosen the word interdependent. And instead of &ldquo;human-centred&rdquo; I would have chosen &ldquo;un-centered&rdquo; or &ldquo;distributed&rdquo;. But let&rsquo;s not get lost in the weeds.</p>\n<p>I know that this manifesto is very much of its time and reacts to platformism, late capitalism and the threat of &ldquo;Big AI&rdquo;. But I think it is important to realize that the society of the web needs to be assembled slowly, carefully, facing the complexities ahead by remaking - I would say - what here &amp; now means, by taking more time examining what lies before us.</p>\n<p>Sounds nebolous? But questions like the following arise from this stance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&ldquo;How exactly are we going to think of a web society?&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;How can an individual take meaningful steps?&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;What does it mean to not filter out by categories, those who are &ldquo;un-progressive&rdquo; or &ldquo;progressive with an asterisk&rdquo; but to describe a prospective future?&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;What series of steps can be taken as an assembly of actors (a team, a company, a neighborhood)?&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;What is implied by the difference of being un/humane? Are those who are humane able to sustain themselves in any way? How? Can we separate them from the un-humane ones? How? Is this a stable difference? Who differentiates?&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think the most understandable way I can put this - because I get annoyed by the way I have to express this as well, a little: If this manifesto and <a href=\"https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com\">others like it that it links to</a> point at something, is this something served by the playbook of exclusion/inclusion, sorting and filtering out? I imagine that whatever the humane web could be, it would express itself less in terms of framing out what it is not by underlining what it is, but by exploring what would make it possible to exist at all. What are the technologies, processes, organizational forms, ways of observing, tending to, maintaining, caring for and negotiating that could make a different web?

				"title": "A New Cross-Posting Workflow, Part 1: Requirements And Thoughts On Implementation",
				"content_html": "<p>(2024-05-20 - EDIT: I have decided, that I do not have enough time to devote to this project at this time, however I would really like it and it was good to think this through for when I am able to pick it up)</p>\n<p>You know what I don&rsquo;t like about my blog? The way it crossposts to other services. Micro.blog&rsquo;s understanding of cross-posting is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Micro.blog cross-posting copies your posts from this feed to external services automatically when you post to your blog.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which is not what I want. I would like it to work more in this way:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blog posts (with our without title) should be shared automatically on <a href=\"https://social.lol/@matti\">my Mastodon account</a> with a proper link, maybe an applicable hashtag. But it should be clear that I&rsquo;m sharing a blog post, which is not the same as writing a toot and that difference shouldn&rsquo;t therefore be invisible by just tooting the same content 1:1 as I posted on my blog</li>\n<li>An exception are the <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/categories/dailydogo/\">DailyDogos</a> and other posts like it (not that there are any at the moment…). These should be shared with the image attached. Maybe there is not even a need for the link, but it would be fine if it would be there</li>\n<li>When I&rsquo;m writing a toot, I&rsquo;d like my blog to archive a copy of that toot. The archived version should include images, links and whathaveyou.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So basically there are two workflows with a couple of conditionals I would like to implement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cross-Post all blog posts from my micro.blog to my mastodon (excluding posts that are archival copies of mastodon posts; denoted by being part of the category &ldquo;archivalCopyOfToot&rdquo;)\n<ul>\n<li>if the post has a title, use the title to create a link to the post and add any applicable hashtags by converting the assigned categories of said blog post to the toot</li>\n<li>if the post has no title\n<ul>\n<li>if the post has category of &ldquo;tootAsIs&rdquo;\n<ul>\n<li>add any images to the toot and post the contents of the blog post as is to mastodon (maybe add a link to the original on my blog)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>if the post has no category of &ldquo;tootAsIs&rdquo;\n<ul>\n<li>add a short (80 Chars and up to the next full word maybe?) excerpt and otherwise behave like a titled post</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I happen to have an <a href=\"https://echofeed.app\">Echofeed</a> account, which is part of the solution. I can point it at an RSS/JSON/Atom-Feed and it will post in a format I can specify to any of its supported services, which includes Mastodon and Micro.blog. It doesn&rsquo;t have any conditional logic, though, so I will have to provide it with feeds that only include posts that I want it to cross post.</p>\n<p>On the micro.blog side, this is maybe <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2023/06/18/the-hugo-template.html\">not trivial</a>, but at least is possible, since micro.blog uses <a href=\"https://gohugo.io\">Hugo</a> and you can - if you know how - customize it quite a bit. I&rsquo;ll need three feeds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A feed with only title posts, excluding any posts with the category &ldquo;archivalCopyOfToot&rdquo;</li>\n<li>A feed with only non-title posts, including only those of &ldquo;tootAsIs&rdquo; (and excluding any from the category &ldquo;archivalCopyOfToot&rdquo;)</li>\n<li>A feed with only non-title, excluding any of &ldquo;tootAsIs&rdquo; AND &ldquo;archivalCopyOfToot&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I would then set up three echos that cross post to mastodon in the right way.</p>\n<p>Mastodon on the other hand has <a href=\"https://social.lol/@matti.rss\">a feed of my posts</a> too, but it&rsquo;s much more limited and creating new custom feeds that filter posts based on e.g. a hashtag are not possible, I believe. This means that we can&rsquo;t filter for cross-posted blog posts and will necessarily import those items to our blog, too. I would really like to avoid having to run my own script - locally or on a server - talking to their api or whatever, so I think I&rsquo;ll will have to live with the fact these duplicated posts will be crossposted back to my blog…</p>\n<p>What I can do is filter these posts out on the micro.blog side. Meaning posts that include a certain Hashtag like &ldquo;crossPostByEchoFeed&rdquo; (this could even be added inside Echofeed for the workflow that posts from Mastodon to MB and could be invisible to Mastodon followers) need to be excluded from the homepage, archive and any feeds of my blog (hashtags can be converted to categories using filters on micro.blog, so if I figure out how to filter by one or more categories in Hugo&rsquo;s template syntax, I should be fine implementing this).

				"content_text": "(2024-05-20 - EDIT: I have decided, that I do not have enough time to devote to this project at this time, however I would really like it and it was good to think this through for when I am able to pick it up)\n\nYou know what I don't like about my blog? The way it crossposts to other services. Micro.blog's understanding of cross-posting is as follows:\n\n>Micro.blog cross-posting copies your posts from this feed to external services automatically when you post to your blog.\n\nWhich is not what I want. I would like it to work more in this way:\n\n- Blog posts (with our without title) should be shared automatically on [my Mastodon account](https://social.lol/@matti) with a proper link, maybe an applicable hashtag. But it should be clear that I'm sharing a blog post, which is not the same as writing a toot and that difference shouldn't therefore be invisible by just tooting the same content 1:1 as I posted on my blog\n- An exception are the [DailyDogos](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/categories/dailydogo/) and other posts like it (not that there are any at the moment…). These should be shared with the image attached. Maybe there is not even a need for the link, but it would be fine if it would be there\n- When I'm writing a toot, I'd like my blog to archive a copy of that toot. The archived version should include images, links and whathaveyou.\n\nSo basically there are two workflows with a couple of conditionals I would like to implement:\n\n- Cross-Post all blog posts from my micro.blog to my mastodon (excluding posts that are archival copies of mastodon posts; denoted by being part of the category \"archivalCopyOfToot\")\n\t- if the post has a title, use the title to create a link to the post and add any applicable hashtags by converting the assigned categories of said blog post to the toot\n\t- if the post has no title\n\t\t- if the post has category of \"tootAsIs\"\n\t\t\t- add any images to the toot and post the contents of the blog post as is to mastodon (maybe add a link to the original on my blog)\n\t\t- if the post has no category of \"tootAsIs\"\n\t\t\t- add a short (80 Chars and up to the next full word maybe?) excerpt and otherwise behave like a titled post\n\n\nI happen to have an [Echofeed](https://echofeed.app) account, which is part of the solution. I can point it at an RSS/JSON/Atom-Feed and it will post in a format I can specify to any of its supported services, which includes Mastodon and Micro.blog. It doesn't have any conditional logic, though, so I will have to provide it with feeds that only include posts that I want it to cross post.\n\nOn the micro.blog side, this is maybe [not trivial](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2023/06/18/the-hugo-template.html), but at least is possible, since micro.blog uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and you can - if you know how - customize it quite a bit. I'll need three feeds:\n\n- A feed with only title posts, excluding any posts with the category \"archivalCopyOfToot\"\n- A feed with only non-title posts, including only those of \"tootAsIs\" (and excluding any from the category \"archivalCopyOfToot\")\n- A feed with only non-title, excluding any of \"tootAsIs\" AND \"archivalCopyOfToot\"\n\nI would then set up three echos that cross post to mastodon in the right way.\n\nMastodon on the other hand has [a feed of my posts](https://social.lol/@matti.rss) too, but it's much more limited and creating new custom feeds that filter posts based on e.g. a hashtag are not possible, I believe. This means that we can't filter for cross-posted blog posts and will necessarily import those items to our blog, too. I would really like to avoid having to run my own script - locally or on a server - talking to their api or whatever, so I think I'll will have to live with the fact these duplicated posts will be crossposted back to my blog…\n\nWhat I can do is filter these posts out on the micro.blog side. Meaning posts that include a certain Hashtag like \"crossPostByEchoFeed\" (this could even be added inside Echofeed for the workflow that posts from Mastodon to MB and could be invisible to Mastodon followers) need to be excluded from the homepage, archive and any feeds of my blog (hashtags can be converted to categories using filters on micro.blog, so if I figure out how to filter by one or more categories in Hugo's template syntax, I should be fine implementing this). In that way they will be part of the blog, but they will not pollute the reading experience.\n\nSo yes. I have to set up some feeds and some logic to make undesired toots invisible but then I should be able to get what I want without the need to setup any scripts run by me.\n",

I&rsquo;m very apprehensive changing themes and other things that I consider default behavior. Because this either means maintenance for me or maintenance for somebody else. I&rsquo;m not a very visual person especially when I have to create things. I want to write and I want it to look okay, but I&rsquo;m not sweating it if the blog looks antiquated or whatever. However, a blog needs some form of a (design) theme and so I have generally opted for whatever the default is. The default is going to be maintained no matter what so it&rsquo;s a pretty safe bet. One thing that irks me a lot about micro.blog&rsquo;s default theme: How invisible the categories are! They are only visible on the archive page, not in the list of posts and not on the single post page either. I find this very impractical, because you can&rsquo;t browse other posts in the same category. Another thing is that the default theme doesn&rsquo;t do proper pagination. The homepage just includes 20 or so posts and that&rsquo;s it. You have to go to the archive page to see more posts, but there they are only visible in a truncated fashion. Long story short: I changed the theme! This one is called <a href=\"https://github.com/microdotblog/theme-minos\">Minos</a> and shows the categories above every post and has pagination.

Man lebte und dann bildete man sich eine Meinung und dann lebt man jetzt und zieht Bezüge, hält Dinge für gleich, möglich, wahrscheinlich, idiotisch, usw. Aber eben ob der Bezugspunkte. Und gleichzeitig komme ich nicht umhin festzustellen, dass das Leben jenseits eigener Kategorisierungen stattfindet und es wird zumindest behauptet, dass das auch funktioniert. Gemeint ist auch: Der Versuch hier etwas zum Konfliktpotenzial im Zwischenmenschlichen zu sagen. Worauf ich stolz bin: Dass es häufig nicht lang dauert sich zu vertragen. Wir nagen an den Resten unserer Reserven, ja ja. Aber mit uns kann man das machen, denken wir vielleicht nicht mal, aber leben wir, machen es mit uns.\n\nSo der Umzug. Lediglich zu zweit. Von -34 Grad bis +2. Eine Strecke: 3h. Viele Wochen. Viele Strecken. Mehrere All-Nighter dabei. Schon auch stolz ja. Aber vor allem froh es überstanden zu haben.\n\nMuss los.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>This year had so much potential and after two tough years in a row, I was really looking forward to a better one. If I focus on myself, the year was <em>okay</em>: I switched jobs for the better and worked on improving my overall approach to productivity. But as soon as I widen the circle even slightly, it becomes clear it was a bad year. There are no two ways about it: The year&rsquo;s end made it impossible to call it anything else.</p>\n<h2 id=\"an-awful-end\">An Awful End</h2>\n<p>The year took its most challenging turn when my partner lost her job in December. It was sudden and unexpected, but she handled it with incredible grace and professionalism. Despite our frustrations with the political climate affecting jobs, we need to learn to adapt and find new paths. We will be fine, but there&rsquo;s a lingering sadness over losing the relative safety we felt through all these challenging years since the pandemic.</p>\n<h2 id=\"health-concerns\">Health Concerns</h2>\n<p>Additionally, towards the end of the year, my grandparents' health became more of a concern, reminding me to cherish every moment with them. I&rsquo;m particularly proud of my grandpa&rsquo;s bravery as he has started to undergo severe cancer treatment in December.</p>\n<h2 id=\"christmas-woes\">Christmas Woes</h2>\n<p>Despite our careful planning and genuine excitement, Christmas turned out to be less than ideal. A series of small mishaps unfolded: the toilet in our train compartment was broken, we initially got the wrong type of hotel room, endured a terrible experience at a shopping mall, narrowly avoided a traffic accident, struggled with Napu&rsquo;s sound sensitivity that cost us a lot of sleep. I also fell ill on Christmas Eve, spending the day in the hotel room instead of with family. These issues, even though not that bad on their own, taken as one left us feeling quite upset. This was especially sad for me, because I had looked forward to the holiday in a way I hadn&rsquo;t in many years.</p>\n<p>However, I want to think there is a silver lining in this experience. We&rsquo;ve learned some valuable lessons for future holidays, like the benefits of taking a car train instead of driving over 800 kilometers ourselves and choosing to stay in a hotel for space to decompress and rest.</p>\n<h2 id=\"brighter-moments\">Brighter Moments</h2>\n<p>Amidst these challenges, there were highlights in the first three quarters of the year. I&rsquo;m thrilled about my new job, which I started in July. I have not only nice colleagues, but nice bosses, too. The work environment is open to my ideas and the tasks are challenging but well suited to my skills.</p>\n<p>Our summer was wonderful, including a memorable trip to Finland&rsquo;s Perämeri National Park, visiting Kilpisjärvi once more and finally hiking through Malla&rsquo;s strict nature reserve. Perämeri is special, because it&rsquo;s challenging to visit (it consists of a group of islands and you need to hire a water taxi to get there).</p>\n<p>Beyond these trips, there were countless wonderful moments in our day-to-day life, too: solving jigsaw puzzles, watching TV, hiking day trails and collecting berries.

				"content_text": "This year had so much potential and after two tough years in a row, I was really looking forward to a better one. If I focus on myself, the year was _okay_: I switched jobs for the better and worked on improving my overall approach to productivity. But as soon as I widen the circle even slightly, it becomes clear it was a bad year. There are no two ways about it: The year's end made it impossible to call it anything else.\n\n## An Awful End\n\nThe year took its most challenging turn when my partner lost her job in December. It was sudden and unexpected, but she handled it with incredible grace and professionalism. Despite our frustrations with the political climate affecting jobs, we need to learn to adapt and find new paths. We will be fine, but there's a lingering sadness over losing the relative safety we felt through all these challenging years since the pandemic.\n\n## Health Concerns\n\nAdditionally, towards the end of the year, my grandparents' health became more of a concern, reminding me to cherish every moment with them. I'm particularly proud of my grandpa's bravery as he has started to undergo severe cancer treatment in December.\n\n## Christmas Woes\n\nDespite our careful planning and genuine excitement, Christmas turned out to be less than ideal. A series of small mishaps unfolded: the toilet in our train compartment was broken, we initially got the wrong type of hotel room, endured a terrible experience at a shopping mall, narrowly avoided a traffic accident, struggled with Napu's sound sensitivity that cost us a lot of sleep. I also fell ill on Christmas Eve, spending the day in the hotel room instead of with family. These issues, even though not that bad on their own, taken as one left us feeling quite upset. This was especially sad for me, because I had looked forward to the holiday in a way I hadn't in many years.\n\nHowever, I want to think there is a silver lining in this experience. We've learned some valuable lessons for future holidays, like the benefits of taking a car train instead of driving over 800 kilometers ourselves and choosing to stay in a hotel for space to decompress and rest.\n\n## Brighter Moments\n\nAmidst these challenges, there were highlights in the first three quarters of the year. I'm thrilled about my new job, which I started in July. I have not only nice colleagues, but nice bosses, too. The work environment is open to my ideas and the tasks are challenging but well suited to my skills.\n\nOur summer was wonderful, including a memorable trip to Finland's Perämeri National Park, visiting Kilpisjärvi once more and finally hiking through Malla's strict nature reserve. Perämeri is special, because it's challenging to visit (it consists of a group of islands and you need to hire a water taxi to get there).\n\nBeyond these trips, there were countless wonderful moments in our day-to-day life, too: solving jigsaw puzzles, watching TV, hiking day trails and collecting berries. Despite ups and downs, we had many opportunities to laugh and enjoy each other's company - and we did.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/44388/2024/img-4905.jpeg\" alt=\"Two bowls full of blue berries are held in a forest environment. The hands are stained red from blue berry juice. In the background a dog is visible.\" title=\"IMG_4905.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" />\n\nWhile interacting with Napu this year, I learned the importance of understanding trigger stacking, letting her make choices and providing her with a safe and positive environment to learn and grow. She was a joy to have with and around us.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/44388/2024/img-6842.jpeg\" alt=\"A dog is laying belly up in front of sofa. There are toys and a chewing bone next to her head. She is watching into the camera.\" title=\"IMG_6842.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" />\n\n## Personal Growth\n\nEven in a bad year there's things to learn and take with me into what comes next. Here's an incomplete list of some of the things I found valuable to have learned this year:\n\n- I am pretty sure that I'd like to focus my efforts to grow professionally in the direction of code quality and software architecture. This is not the same as trying to become a tech lead or manager. And it's good to know the difference.\n- I have learned that it's okay to watch VODs of the same Slay The Spire Streamers on Youtube while playing Dead Cells. This is my way to relax. **I don't need to impress anyone while relaxing.** If this is what my brain wants to do after a hard day, that's fine.\n- Between 10 am and 1 pm is my crunch time. This is when my brain is the most capable and my environment permits the most undistracted work. It hasn't always been that way. I was able to do some of my best work in the evenings before but this has changed. I feel like it's immensely helpful to know when I can do my best work, because that means I know now which time slot needs to be protected the most.\n- I learned that positive emotions make the biggest difference in habit formation. If I can bring myself to authentically feel good about doing a thing, chances are high(er) that I will do the same thing when I encounter the same trigger later. The old view is that habits form through repetition alone, but it's actually the immediate positive feedback that I can induce myself by celebrating right after I did a thing that makes all the difference.\n- Skipping breakfast as a form of intermittent fasting is actually not that hard.\n- LLMs may be ethically and environmentally questionable but they are tools that are insanely helpful. They are here to stay. I have found great use cases and have had a chance to play around with more advanced features thanks to a GPTPlus subscription through my company.\n- I took steps to improve my productivity setup this year and a couple of things that I feel like I finally understood:\n\t- **Use one tool to keep a certain kind of data** (Task? OmniFocus, Note? Obsidian, Event? Fantastical. Misc. Reminder I can't miss? Due.), link tasks and notes, but don't write notes into your task management app and reminders for tasks or notes into your calendar.

However, I'm approaching 2024 with cautious optimism.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/44388/2024/img-5107.jpeg\" alt=\"I man is raising a thermos cup of coffee into the camera while sitting in a hilly forested nature setting, next to a dog and a woman.\" title=\"IMG_5107.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"450\" />\n\nWhat makes a good year is a smaller gap between my expectations and reality, leading to fewer disappointments. The new year will be about managing expectations and rolling with the punches. I'm prepared to do both!\n\n\n- [Previously.](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2023/01/06/previously-this-last.html)\n",

He then gives an example where spending relatively little money on an event doesn&rsquo;t mean that that event couldn&rsquo;t be more meaningful than another event that you spent more on. What Greenfeld has discovered is that you can&rsquo;t compare single events like this but must compare topics: The question is how do you spend your time - over your lifetime? Comparing two singular events doesn&rsquo;t make sense. But whether you spend your life mostly at networking dinners vs. mostly with your family does.

It&rsquo;s not really part of the discussion - lip service aside - when considering changes to a software system.</p>\n<p>I acknowledge the importance of all the ethical issues named und unnamed above, but want to concentrate on environmental issues here: The tech industry as a whole is constantly incentivized to offer and use more resources: It has become standard to expect new computers to be faster and so newer software tends to be more resource hungry than older software. What does that mean, exactly? Well, new hardware needs resources in production to make all the chips, cards, and so on, that&rsquo;s obvious to anyone. But resources are also needed  when using our hardware: A modern laptop generally doesn&rsquo;t require that much power to be used by us, but what about the internet? The data centers that host most of the services we use today and that make up a big part of our modern understanding of what using a computing device should feel like, are insanely resource hungry. Take this example of data centers using fresh water to cool its facilities:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In The Dalles, Oregon, Google was found to be using a quarter of the city’s water supply to cool its facilities. Tech companies have been facing pushback elsewhere in the United States, but also across the world in places like Uruguay, Chile, the Netherlands, Ireland, and New Zealand. Now opposition is growing in Spain too, where droughts are wiping out crops and people are wondering why they’d give their limited water resources to Meta for a data center.\n— <a href=\"https://www.disconnect.blog/p/the-chatgpt-revolution-is-another\">The ChatGPT revolution is another tech fantasy</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The French think tank &ldquo;the shift project&rdquo; <a href=\"https://theshiftproject.org/en/article/unsustainable-use-online-video/\">estimated</a>  that about 4% of green house gas emissions are the result of the use of digital services and that this figure grows by 9% every year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"automation-and-software-quality\">Automation and software quality</h3>\n<p>A modern software development workflow consists of many pieces, incorporates many different perspectives and hast to take a lot of concerns into account. After all, modern businesses model their processes in software, report, plan and reflect in software and are maybe even selling software products through software market places. Business processes tend to be very complex, simply by virtue of having to deal with historical ballast, future visions, differing politics within the company and a shifting environment in which the software has to function, not to speak of the process itself, which touches many different stake holders that all need different things from a company to do their work.</p>\n<p>Because of this, the software development cycle of gathering requirements, implementation, testing and release has started - more than 10 years ago - to accumulate lots of automation tools that are being referred to as continuous integration (ci). For example: When you develop software you often want to make sure that your new feature works as expected before you release a new version of your software. For this, people have developed testing tools. So people would write not only the feature but also a test (or tests) to make sure that the feature does what it should: This basically means you would define inputs and expected outputs and make sure that the new feature returns those expected values, when feeding the defined inputs. When a developer runs their test, they can see that the new feature works. This is great, but it&rsquo;s even greater when used down the road: Because a newer feature could accidentally change the behavior of a system in an unexpected way. With tests you can make sure that deployed code is more resilient against such accidental changes.</p>\n<p>An important part of modern development is the code review. So a developer would implement a feature, write tests and send their changes as a merge request (or pull request) to a colleague for review purposes. That colleague would check for any missed requirements, errors in the implementation, code smells and so on. There is a little back and forth between reviewer and programmer and if all is well the code is approved and can be deployed to a test system for a quality assurance colleague to manually test the change, before it then finally finds its way into the &ldquo;live&rdquo; software version used by a normal user.</p>\n<p>The code review process is especially important in terms of code quality, that is, in terms of aspects of the code that are rarely user facing but nonetheless are a very important part of a resilient application - scalable, easy to test, easy to change, etc. In other words: code review is supposed to help and (often times) ensure a high standard of quality in the codebase.</p>\n<p>Back to ci: Continuous integration can automatically find and often times fix a great many problems with new - and old, outdated - code. First of all, it can run all the software tests to ensure backwards compatibility. It can also run a linter, which ensures a consistent style (indentation, order of parts of code, naming scheme, etc.). This improves readability and ensures that a person familiar with one part of the system doesn&rsquo;t need to parse everything about this unknown part of the system: the files look the same and things are generally named as you would expect them to be, and so on.</p>\n<p>You can go further. You can let a static analysis tool run, to catch things like giving the wrong inputs to a function (e.g. input is a floating number, but this function expects an integer; in a dynamically typed language like PHP you might catch this error only when the code is actually run - but you want to catch that mistake and fix it before it is encountered in the wild). There are many, many other things where static analysis of a codebase in light of new changes can reveal problems that would otherwise go unnoticed until it&rsquo;s too late.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s automated testing, linting, static analysis and more tools like &ldquo;mess detectors&rdquo; that try to detect valid code but that constitutes generally considered bad programming practices. All of these tools would run before a code reviewer even gets to see the code. Issues with agreed upon standards will be brought up and fixed - in some cases even automatically - before another human even has to see the code. This in the end saves time, improves focus - because humans are not good in spotting standard violations and even prevents some lengthy discussions in some cases - because the machine is dispassionate and just enforces a standard that was agreed upon in the company.</p>\n<p>But you can go further. A relatively new idea is to also take software architecture into account when talking about ci. Software architecture is a whole can of worms in itself, but one important concern, as an example, is modularity: You want your code neatly organized so that the whole system stays open to replacement, improvement, extension, change, and so on. You could make sure, for example, that different parts of the system do not talk directly with each other, by defining application layers that separate different parts of the system from another to ensure a sensible organizational structure of the whole. Well, you can test for that in your ci pipeline - the pipeline is what runs all your defined code quality tools, linters and so on - as well, by defining an &ldquo;architectural fitness function&rdquo;:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the 2017 book Building Evolutionary Architectures (O’Reilly), the authors (Neal Ford, Rebecca Parsons, and Patrick Kua) defined the concept of an architectural fitness function: any mechanism that performs an objective integrity assessment of some architecture characteristic or combination of architecture characteristics.\n— <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-the/9781492086888/\">Software Architecture: The Hard Parts, &ldquo;Using Fitness Functions&rdquo;</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With a function defined you can also write a test in a tool like <a href=\"https://github.com/carlosas/phpat\">phpat</a>. Here&rsquo;s an example from the readme of this project:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-php\" data-lang=\"php\"><span style=\"color:#f92672\">&lt;?</span><span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">php</span>\n\n<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">use</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">PHPat\\Selector\\Selector</span>;\n<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">use</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">PHPat\\Test\\Builder\\Rule</span>;\n<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">use</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">PHPat\\Test\\PHPat</span>;\n<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">use</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">App\\Domain\\SuperForbiddenClass</span>;\n\n<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">class</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">MyFirstTest</span>\n{\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">public</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">function</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">test_domain_does_not_depend_on_other_layers</span>()<span style=\"color:#f92672\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">Rule</span>\n    {\n        <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">return</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">PHPat</span><span style=\"color:#f92672\">::</span><span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">rule</span>()\n            <span style=\"color:#f92672\">-&gt;</span><span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">classes</span>(<span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">Selector</span><span style=\"color:#f92672\">::</span><span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">namespace</span>(<span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#39;App\\Domain&#39;</span>))\n            <span style=\"color:#f92672\">-&gt;</span><span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">shouldNotDependOn</span>()\n            <span style=\"color:#f92672\">-&gt;</span><span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">classes</span>(\n                <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">Selector</span><span style=\"color:#f92672\">::</span><span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">namespace</span>(<span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#39;App\\Application&#39;</span>),\n                <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">Selector</span><span style=\"color:#f92672\">::</span><span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">namespace</span>(<span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#39;App\\Infrastructure&#39;</span>),\n                <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">Selector</span><span style=\"color:#f92672\">::</span><span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">classname</span>(<span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">SuperForbiddenClass</span><span style=\"color:#f92672\">::</span><span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">class</span>),\n                <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">Selector</span><span style=\"color:#f92672\">::</span><span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">classname</span>(<span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#39;/^SomeVendor\\\\\\.*\\\\\\ForbiddenSubfolder\\\\\\.*/&#39;</span>, <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">true</span>)\n            );\n    }\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>And just as with your tests that are supposed to test that the code does what it does, you can test that it does so in an integrity conserving way with an architectural testing tool like this.</p>\n<h3 id=\"automating-measuring-environmental-impact\">Automating measuring environmental impact</h3>\n<p>But you can do more: We started this discussion with pondering ethical issues and the impact a software developer&rsquo;s work has. You can now for example measure carbon footprint and energy consumption in a similar fashion in your ci pipeline as all the other things we have mentioned above. An example is <a href=\"https://github.com/marmelab/greenframe-cli\">greenframe</a> that does this for web apps.</p>\n<p>As with all concerns: A measurement is only as good as the idea of what you&rsquo;re trying to measure. Just as with coding standards, testing and architecture, automatic validation and measurement is only good if you measure for a reason - and figuring out that reason will continue being a hard problem. What automation can do, though, is performing consistent measurements of your codebase, which you can then use to gauge the environmental software quality of your project.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This wraps up this somewhat lengthy blog post. I wish that companies running especially resource hungry applications - like the AIs of today - would incorporate environmental concerns in their assessment of software quality. Because how good is a software really, if it is not built environmentally conscious?</p>\n",

It's not really part of the discussion - lip service aside - when considering changes to a software system.\n\nI acknowledge the importance of all the ethical issues named und unnamed above, but want to concentrate on environmental issues here: The tech industry as a whole is constantly incentivized to offer and use more resources: It has become standard to expect new computers to be faster and so newer software tends to be more resource hungry than older software. What does that mean, exactly? Well, new hardware needs resources in production to make all the chips, cards, and so on, that's obvious to anyone. But resources are also needed  when using our hardware: A modern laptop generally doesn't require that much power to be used by us, but what about the internet? The data centers that host most of the services we use today and that make up a big part of our modern understanding of what using a computing device should feel like, are insanely resource hungry. Take this example of data centers using fresh water to cool its facilities: \n\n>In The Dalles, Oregon, Google was found to be using a quarter of the city’s water supply to cool its facilities. Tech companies have been facing pushback elsewhere in the United States, but also across the world in places like Uruguay, Chile, the Netherlands, Ireland, and New Zealand. Now opposition is growing in Spain too, where droughts are wiping out crops and people are wondering why they’d give their limited water resources to Meta for a data center.\n>— [The ChatGPT revolution is another tech fantasy](https://www.disconnect.blog/p/the-chatgpt-revolution-is-another)\n\nThe French think tank \"the shift project\" [estimated](https://theshiftproject.org/en/article/unsustainable-use-online-video/)  that about 4% of green house gas emissions are the result of the use of digital services and that this figure grows by 9% every year.\n\n### Automation and software quality\n\nA modern software development workflow consists of many pieces, incorporates many different perspectives and hast to take a lot of concerns into account. After all, modern businesses model their processes in software, report, plan and reflect in software and are maybe even selling software products through software market places. Business processes tend to be very complex, simply by virtue of having to deal with historical ballast, future visions, differing politics within the company and a shifting environment in which the software has to function, not to speak of the process itself, which touches many different stake holders that all need different things from a company to do their work.\n\nBecause of this, the software development cycle of gathering requirements, implementation, testing and release has started - more than 10 years ago - to accumulate lots of automation tools that are being referred to as continuous integration (ci). For example: When you develop software you often want to make sure that your new feature works as expected before you release a new version of your software. For this, people have developed testing tools. So people would write not only the feature but also a test (or tests) to make sure that the feature does what it should: This basically means you would define inputs and expected outputs and make sure that the new feature returns those expected values, when feeding the defined inputs. When a developer runs their test, they can see that the new feature works. This is great, but it's even greater when used down the road: Because a newer feature could accidentally change the behavior of a system in an unexpected way. With tests you can make sure that deployed code is more resilient against such accidental changes.\n\nAn important part of modern development is the code review. So a developer would implement a feature, write tests and send their changes as a merge request (or pull request) to a colleague for review purposes. That colleague would check for any missed requirements, errors in the implementation, code smells and so on. There is a little back and forth between reviewer and programmer and if all is well the code is approved and can be deployed to a test system for a quality assurance colleague to manually test the change, before it then finally finds its way into the \"live\" software version used by a normal user.\n\nThe code review process is especially important in terms of code quality, that is, in terms of aspects of the code that are rarely user facing but nonetheless are a very important part of a resilient application - scalable, easy to test, easy to change, etc. In other words: code review is supposed to help and (often times) ensure a high standard of quality in the codebase.\n\nBack to ci: Continuous integration can automatically find and often times fix a great many problems with new - and old, outdated - code. First of all, it can run all the software tests to ensure backwards compatibility. It can also run a linter, which ensures a consistent style (indentation, order of parts of code, naming scheme, etc.). This improves readability and ensures that a person familiar with one part of the system doesn't need to parse everything about this unknown part of the system: the files look the same and things are generally named as you would expect them to be, and so on.\n\nYou can go further. You can let a static analysis tool run, to catch things like giving the wrong inputs to a function (e.g. input is a floating number, but this function expects an integer; in a dynamically typed language like PHP you might catch this error only when the code is actually run - but you want to catch that mistake and fix it before it is encountered in the wild). There are many, many other things where static analysis of a codebase in light of new changes can reveal problems that would otherwise go unnoticed until it's too late.\n\nThere's automated testing, linting, static analysis and more tools like \"mess detectors\" that try to detect valid code but that constitutes generally considered bad programming practices. All of these tools would run before a code reviewer even gets to see the code. Issues with agreed upon standards will be brought up and fixed - in some cases even automatically - before another human even has to see the code. This in the end saves time, improves focus - because humans are not good in spotting standard violations and even prevents some lengthy discussions in some cases - because the machine is dispassionate and just enforces a standard that was agreed upon in the company.\n\nBut you can go further. A relatively new idea is to also take software architecture into account when talking about ci. Software architecture is a whole can of worms in itself, but one important concern, as an example, is modularity: You want your code neatly organized so that the whole system stays open to replacement, improvement, extension, change, and so on. You could make sure, for example, that different parts of the system do not talk directly with each other, by defining application layers that separate different parts of the system from another to ensure a sensible organizational structure of the whole. Well, you can test for that in your ci pipeline - the pipeline is what runs all your defined code quality tools, linters and so on - as well, by defining an \"architectural fitness function\":\n\n>In the 2017 book Building Evolutionary Architectures (O’Reilly), the authors (Neal Ford, Rebecca Parsons, and Patrick Kua) defined the concept of an architectural fitness function: any mechanism that performs an objective integrity assessment of some architecture characteristic or combination of architecture characteristics.\n— [Software Architecture: The Hard Parts, \"Using Fitness Functions\"](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-the/9781492086888/)\n\nWith a function defined you can also write a test in a tool like [phpat](https://github.com/carlosas/phpat). Here's an example from the readme of this project:\n\n```php\n<?php\n\nuse PHPat\\Selector\\Selector;\nuse PHPat\\Test\\Builder\\Rule;\nuse PHPat\\Test\\PHPat;\nuse App\\Domain\\SuperForbiddenClass;\n\nclass MyFirstTest\n{\n    public function test_domain_does_not_depend_on_other_layers(): Rule\n    {\n        return PHPat::rule()\n            ->classes(Selector::namespace('App\\Domain'))\n            ->shouldNotDependOn()\n            ->classes(\n                Selector::namespace('App\\Application'),\n                Selector::namespace('App\\Infrastructure'),\n                Selector::classname(SuperForbiddenClass::class),\n                Selector::classname('/^SomeVendor\\\\\\.*\\\\\\ForbiddenSubfolder\\\\\\.*/', true)\n            );\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd just as with your tests that are supposed to test that the code does what it does, you can test that it does so in an integrity conserving way with an architectural testing tool like this.\n\n### Automating measuring environmental impact\n\nBut you can do more: We started this discussion with pondering ethical issues and the impact a software developer's work has. You can now for example measure carbon footprint and energy consumption in a similar fashion in your ci pipeline as all the other things we have mentioned above. An example is [greenframe](https://github.com/marmelab/greenframe-cli) that does this for web apps.\n\nAs with all concerns: A measurement is only as good as the idea of what you're trying to measure. Just as with coding standards, testing and architecture, automatic validation and measurement is only good if you measure for a reason - and figuring out that reason will continue being a hard problem. What automation can do, though, is performing consistent measurements of your codebase, which you can then use to gauge the environmental software quality of your project.\n\n* * *\n\nThis wraps up this somewhat lengthy blog post. I wish that companies running especially resource hungry applications - like the AIs of today - would incorporate environmental concerns in their assessment of software quality. Because how good is a software really, if it is not built environmentally conscious?\n",

				"content_html": "<p>There is no two ways about it. It&rsquo;s just bad and often counterintuitive. It&rsquo;s hard to read, hard to write, hard to debug, hard to fill in blanks. Easy things should be easy and hard things should be possible. I feel like everything is just hard with it - not impossible per se, but often harder then it should be.</p>\n<p>I mean just look at this one line:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-go-html-template\" data-lang=\"go-html-template\"><span style=\"color:#75715e\">{{</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">$paginator</span> <span style=\"color:#f92672\">:=</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">.Paginate</span> <span style=\"color:#f92672\">(</span><span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">where</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">.Site.Pages.ByDate.Reverse</span> <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;Type&#34;</span> <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;post&#34;</span><span style=\"color:#f92672\">)</span> <span style=\"color:#f92672\">(</span><span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">index</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">.Site.Params</span> <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;archive-paginate&#34;</span> <span style=\"color:#f92672\">|</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">default</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">25</span><span style=\"color:#f92672\">)</span> <span style=\"color:#75715e\">}}</span>\n</code></pre></div><p>This does/means the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>$paginator</code> - that&rsquo;s a custom variable, it needs to be prefixed with a <code>$</code></li>\n<li><code>:=</code> - you need to use this operator to declare a variable and assign a value. But later it&rsquo;s fine to just use <code>=</code> to reassign it.</li>\n<li><code>.</code>  - &ldquo;the dot&rdquo;. It holds the context, which is basically a kind of scope. Why the scope is not implied? I don&rsquo;t know. I guess if you&rsquo;d have a <code>this</code> keyword, you&rsquo;d end up writing <code>this.whatever…</code> and you would still need to differentiate globals and in-scope vars, so I guess that&rsquo;s better?</li>\n<li><code>.Paginate</code> - Inside &ldquo;the dot&rdquo; there exists a <code>Paginate</code> function which has to be upper case because that is the way to make a function visible outside of its &ldquo;package&rdquo; in go. If you look at <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/functions/\">the list of available functions in hugo</a>, you will know that a function was exported, but not why. Also a lot of functions were not exported, but you also do not know why. I assume that the lower case functions are all part of hugo&rsquo;s templating standard lib. But it&rsquo;s not explained what is going on in the docs explicitly.</li>\n<li><code> </code> - A space (yup). Functions and parameters are separated by spaces, so this space indicates the start of the Paginate function call (And not the parentheses in front of the <code>where</code>, as one might think when coming from other languages).</li>\n<li><code>(</code> - The start of the parentheses denotes a nested expression.</li>\n<li><code>where</code> - that&rsquo;s the <code>where</code> function which takes an array and compares a value at a given key using an operator (equals is implied and can be omitted like has been done here) to a value and only keeps the elements that pass the test.</li>\n<li><code>.Site.Pages.ByDate.Reverse</code> - The <code>.Site.Pages</code> part is an array of all pages of the blog. The <code>ByDate.Reverse</code> part is used (and available only) on <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/templates/lists/#what-is-a-list-page-template\">list pages</a> - another detail you&rsquo;ll have to know - that is pages that have other pages under them in the file hierarchy. AND that the homepage is a special kind of list page. This is a snippet from the home page, so you can use it here to change the order of the retrieved array. Why you can&rsquo;t retrieve pages in similar manner on non list pages is unclear to me.</li>\n<li><code>&quot;Type&quot;</code> - This is the key parameter of the <code>where</code> function. The key is &ldquo;Type&rdquo; here. Why is <code>Type</code> capitalized? Maybe it has to because of exports? Maybe it&rsquo;s some other reason that I don&rsquo;t know. In any case it is part of the keys of the element that is kept (or discarded). For the pages array an element includes things like a <code>Permalink</code>, a published <code>Date</code> and a also a <code>Type</code>. How do you know what an element includes? Well, it&rsquo;s hard to say, because the <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/templates/template-debugging/#what-variables-are-available-in-this-context\">proposed solution</a> to use something like <code>&amp;#123;&amp;#123; printf &quot;%#v&quot; . }}</code> within a range function call that references the pages from the <code>Paginator</code> above only prints garbage. An actual solution is to use <code>&lt;pre&gt;&amp;#123;&amp;#123; . | jsonify (dict &quot;indent&quot; &quot; &quot;) }}&lt;/pre&gt;</code> which gives a pretty printed JSON representation of all the available properties within a given context. But you&rsquo;ll not find this solution in the docs, you have to get lucky and find it in the forum or <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64163573/how-to-inspect-variables-in-the-current-scope-in-hugo\">Stack Overflow</a>.</li>\n<li><code>&quot;post&quot;</code> - this is the match parameter of the <code>where</code> function. In other words the value found for the key &ldquo;Type&rdquo; must match this value in order to be included in the filtered array.</li>\n<li><code>) (</code> - we finish one nested expression - which is parameter one of our <code>.Paginate</code> call (the array to paginate) and start another nested expression - parameter two (the page size) of <code>.Paginate</code></li>\n<li><code>index .Site.Params &quot;archive-paginate&quot;</code> - this returns the value at index or key n of a given array. So in this case the value at .SiteParams.archive-paginate</li>\n<li><code> | default 25)</code> if <code>index</code> does not return a value the default function can take over and return a default value. I don&rsquo;t know why this has to be a function. I also find the whole part <code>index .Site.Params &quot;archive-paginate&quot; | default 25</code> difficult to parse: Is the pipe still part of the index function call?

				"content_text": "There is no two ways about it. It's just bad and often counterintuitive. It's hard to read, hard to write, hard to debug, hard to fill in blanks. Easy things should be easy and hard things should be possible. I feel like everything is just hard with it - not impossible per se, but often harder then it should be.\n\nI mean just look at this one line:\n\n```go-html-template\n{{ $paginator := .Paginate (where .Site.Pages.ByDate.Reverse \"Type\" \"post\") (index .Site.Params \"archive-paginate\" | default 25) }}\n```\n\nThis does/means the following:\n\n- `$paginator` - that's a custom variable, it needs to be prefixed with a `$`\n- `:=` - you need to use this operator to declare a variable and assign a value. But later it's fine to just use `=` to reassign it.\n- `.`  - \"the dot\". It holds the context, which is basically a kind of scope. Why the scope is not implied? I don't know. I guess if you'd have a `this` keyword, you'd end up writing `this.whatever…` and you would still need to differentiate globals and in-scope vars, so I guess that's better?\n- `.Paginate` - Inside \"the dot\" there exists a `Paginate` function which has to be upper case because that is the way to make a function visible outside of its \"package\" in go. If you look at [the list of available functions in hugo](https://gohugo.io/functions/), you will know that a function was exported, but not why. Also a lot of functions were not exported, but you also do not know why. I assume that the lower case functions are all part of hugo's templating standard lib. But it's not explained what is going on in the docs explicitly.\n- ` ` - A space (yup). Functions and parameters are separated by spaces, so this space indicates the start of the Paginate function call (And not the parentheses in front of the `where`, as one might think when coming from other languages).\n- `(` - The start of the parentheses denotes a nested expression.\n- `where` - that's the `where` function which takes an array and compares a value at a given key using an operator (equals is implied and can be omitted like has been done here) to a value and only keeps the elements that pass the test.\n- `.Site.Pages.ByDate.Reverse` - The `.Site.Pages` part is an array of all pages of the blog. The `ByDate.Reverse` part is used (and available only) on [list pages](https://gohugo.io/templates/lists/#what-is-a-list-page-template) - another detail you'll have to know - that is pages that have other pages under them in the file hierarchy. AND that the homepage is a special kind of list page. This is a snippet from the home page, so you can use it here to change the order of the retrieved array. Why you can't retrieve pages in similar manner on non list pages is unclear to me.\n- `\"Type\"` - This is the key parameter of the `where` function. The key is \"Type\" here. Why is `Type` capitalized? Maybe it has to because of exports? Maybe it's some other reason that I don't know. In any case it is part of the keys of the element that is kept (or discarded). For the pages array an element includes things like a `Permalink`, a published `Date` and a also a `Type`. How do you know what an element includes? Well, it's hard to say, because the [proposed solution](https://gohugo.io/templates/template-debugging/#what-variables-are-available-in-this-context) to use something like `&#123;&#123; printf \"%#v\" . }}` within a range function call that references the pages from the `Paginator` above only prints garbage. An actual solution is to use `<pre>&#123;&#123; . | jsonify (dict \"indent\" \" \") }}</pre>` which gives a pretty printed JSON representation of all the available properties within a given context. But you'll not find this solution in the docs, you have to get lucky and find it in the forum or [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64163573/how-to-inspect-variables-in-the-current-scope-in-hugo).\n- `\"post\"` - this is the match parameter of the `where` function. In other words the value found for the key \"Type\" must match this value in order to be included in the filtered array.\n- `) (` - we finish one nested expression - which is parameter one of our `.Paginate` call (the array to paginate) and start another nested expression - parameter two (the page size) of `.Paginate`\n- `index .Site.Params \"archive-paginate\"` - this returns the value at index or key n of a given array. So in this case the value at .SiteParams.archive-paginate\n- ` | default 25)` if `index` does not return a value the default function can take over and return a default value. I don't know why this has to be a function. I also find the whole part `index .Site.Params \"archive-paginate\" | default 25` difficult to parse: Is the pipe still part of the index function call? You'll have to know what pipes are.\n\nFinally, we have parsed the whole thing:\n\n```\ninstantiate customVar = \nfunctionCallThatReturnsAPaginator(\n    functionCallThatReturnsAFilteredArray,\n    (\n        functionCallThatReturnsANumber ||\n        functionCallThatReturnsaAdefaultValue\n    )\n)\n```\n\nAnd `.Paginator` itself is just an object that makes it easier to refer to and implement a paged navigation for an array of given elements (posts).\n\nApart from the unusual syntax I find (Hu)go templates hard to parse, even if I grok them somewhat. (Hu)go's way to write function expressions, namely using spaces instead of parentheses and commas make the whole line harder to read than it needs to be. Compare:\n\n```go-html-template\n{{ $paginator := .Paginate (where .Site.Pages.ByDate.Reverse \"Type\" \"post\") (index .Site.Params \"archive-paginate\" | default 25) }}\n```\n\nvs.\n\n```\n{{$paginator := .Paginate(where(.Site.Pages.ByDate.Reverse,\"Type\",\"post\"),(index(.Site.Params,\"archive-paginate\") | default(25)))}}\n```\n\nGranted, this is still hard to read, because a lot is happening in this one line of code, but still: I'd argue it's much easier to parse, because opening and closing parentheses and commas carry much more information than a simple space could. Spaces are also commonly used to align or balance things as has happened around the pipe char. Does this carry semantic meaning? Nope, not in this case!\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/44388/2023/2023-06-19-hugo-templating-sucks-2.jpeg\" alt=\"A visualization of what different symbols of the templating syntax mean in our example. It turns out that the space char carries three differnt meanings: an aesthtic space, a start of a parameter list, a delimiter between parameters.\" title=\"2023-06-19-hugo-templating-sucks-2.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"424\" />\n\nThe space is doing an enormous amount of overtime here and I have yet to see a good justification of muddling the waters like this. The only reason I could see is that you have to balance parentheses, meaning you're ending up with the line ending in `)))`. The best part is that you still need parens in any case, you just have to put them around the whole function expression! The real template version safes you two parentheses for the price of a parsing headache. I feel like that's not worth it.\n\nLet's move on: It should be super easy to limit the list of pages to only include a certain category of posts, right? Would this have been what you'd come up with on the first try?\n\n```go-html-template\n{{ $allPosts := where .Site.Pages.ByDate.Reverse \"Type\" \"post\" }}\n{{ $allDailyDogos := where .Site.Pages \"Params.categories\" \"intersect\" (slice \"DailyDogo\") }}\n{{ $onlyDogos := intersect $allPosts $allDailyDogos }}\n{{ $paginator := .Paginate ($onlyDogos) (index .Site.Params \"archive-paginate\" | default 25) }}\n```\n\nSo far so good. How about the inverse? You'll find that there is no way to tell the line `$allDailyDogos` to simply do the inverse. There is no `\"not intersect\"` or whatever. You have to use another function called `symdiff`:\n\n```go-html-template\n{{ $allPosts := where .Site.Pages.ByDate.Reverse \"Type\" \"post\" }}\n{{ $allDailyDogos := where .Site.Pages \"Params.categories\" \"intersect\" (slice \"DailyDogo\") }}\n{{ $noDogos := symdiff $allDailyDogos $allPosts }}\n{{ $paginator := .Paginate ($noDogos) (index .Site.Params \"archive-paginate\" | default 25) }}\n```\n\nSymdiff is short for [symmetric difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_difference) and means here that we want all elements from the `$allPosts` array that are not part of the `$allDailyDogos` array. Meaning we are keeping only those posts, which is like filtering for the inverse of the `$onlyDogos` array from before.\n\nWe could have mashed this all into one line to make it totally unreadable, but I think this is instructive and it would have not been anymore readable in other template languages (if they even would've been able to deal with this as a one liner).

				"content_html": "<p>As somebody who has taken notes for a long time now, I have gone through iterations of my setup to interact with them (last year <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/08/22/good-apps-agenda.html\">I tried to use Agenda</a> for my periodic and project notes, which I later abandoned in favor of <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/09/22/after-three-months.html\">using exclusively Obsidian again</a>). In the process of moving from one app to the next it was not uncommon to leave notes behind. Not always did this happen intentionally. My current incarnation of my notes system consists of about 5000 notes, when I started to move from Evernote to Obsidian I left thousands of notes behind. If I&rsquo;d need to guess, a count of all of my notes ever written reaches probably around 100000. As I have a full-time job, a little family and little time, my current situation doesn&rsquo;t allow me to do work on my notes all the time.</p>\n<p>So I will probably never be able to collate, deduplicate and unify all my notes into my current system. But I have learned that this is really also not as important as one might think at first. I use my notes system as a way to think and generate new ideas. The argument for having a notes system like this continues usually this way: &ldquo;…and the more ideas you have, the more you&rsquo;ll create/find…&rdquo;. But I think more important than the total amount is to reach <em>a critical mass of notes</em>, which seems to start for me around 50 or so. By this point I seem to be able to always find something to connect to something else. There is always something else to elaborate, so ideas are generated, which is exactly the goal of my system.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t need all my 100000 notes to do it. These 50 notes also don&rsquo;t need to be perfect notes, or only capturing &ldquo;atomic&rdquo; ideas.

				"content_text": "As somebody who has taken notes for a long time now, I have gone through iterations of my setup to interact with them (last year [I tried to use Agenda](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/08/22/good-apps-agenda.html) for my periodic and project notes, which I later abandoned in favor of [using exclusively Obsidian again](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/09/22/after-three-months.html)). In the process of moving from one app to the next it was not uncommon to leave notes behind. Not always did this happen intentionally. My current incarnation of my notes system consists of about 5000 notes, when I started to move from Evernote to Obsidian I left thousands of notes behind. If I'd need to guess, a count of all of my notes ever written reaches probably around 100000. As I have a full-time job, a little family and little time, my current situation doesn't allow me to do work on my notes all the time.\n\nSo I will probably never be able to collate, deduplicate and unify all my notes into my current system. But I have learned that this is really also not as important as one might think at first. I use my notes system as a way to think and generate new ideas. The argument for having a notes system like this continues usually this way: \"…and the more ideas you have, the more you'll create/find…\". But I think more important than the total amount is to reach _a critical mass of notes_, which seems to start for me around 50 or so. By this point I seem to be able to always find something to connect to something else. There is always something else to elaborate, so ideas are generated, which is exactly the goal of my system.\n\nI don't need all my 100000 notes to do it. These 50 notes also don't need to be perfect notes, or only capturing \"atomic\" ideas. Some are short reflexions, others are definitions, quotes, maybe a picture, a copy and pasted line of code. Often times they are daily notes that log what I have done that day with links to other notes. (See also: [The three types of notes I take](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/07/18/the-three-types.html))\n\nHeterogeneity and being in various states of completion are really not a problem, as long as there is enough of a critical mass in the system to generate new notes.\n\nEDIT: You may be interested in my little constellation of \"Notes on Notes\" about the process of working with a notes system:\n\n- [Write Notes](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/01/23/notes-on-notes.html)\n- [Connect Notes](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/01/23/103518.html)\n- [Why do it](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/01/23/104912.html)\n- [Change](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/01/23/110655.html)\n- [Increment by Increment](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/01/23/152840.html)\n\n[Forward](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2023/03/21/an-interesting-difference.html)\n",

Meaning that you are actually not just getting rid of yet another veil that makes you see things more clearly - or on the contrary putting another mask on to make you see things less clearly. Instead your world can&rsquo;t literaly be anything else than what you focus on. If you&rsquo;re focussing on being happy, coping and so on, chances are that your world &ldquo;becomes&rdquo; what you see.</p>\n<p>This is not as simple as just using willpower, however. Not least, because willpower is like a muscle and ego depletion is a real thing. It&rsquo;s also because depression can be thought of as an an active but independently acting agent in your consciousness: Deciding to want to focus on something else is important, but a mental illness wouldn&rsquo;t be called that, if you could &lsquo;just decide&rsquo; and stick to counteracting it.</p>\n<p>This is where therapy can be incredibly helpful: In my experience visiting with a therapist changes your environment, your habits, which is itself - not even taking into account their skill at treating you - an important step to creating lasting behavioral change. But therapists offer also structure on top of just existing in your environment. In my experience they offer a source of serendipity that makes it possible to reach break throughs, new frames of thinking, new ways of looking at things. By showing up and interacting with a therapist you&rsquo;re making a real effort to change what you believe to be the boundaries of your current situation. Yes, this can be in the form of recipe-like  coping strategies, but it can also just mean to interact with an expert on mental health. And that communication has a very high likelihood of being <em>surprising</em> - which is so important to feel something, anything <em>else</em> as regards to your current mental health.</p>\n<p>So in short: We are and our world is what we are focussing on. There is no trick here. Nothing is revealed or hidden by engaging differently with the world, instead it is just that: A different perspective, a different world. To make a sustained effort to change this perspective for good means to change the environment (because willpower alone won&rsquo;t cut it) and to being open to be surprised.</p>\n<p>Medicine can really help in some cases. But even then it&rsquo;s not guaranteed that your conscience is built to accommodate even one new way of perceiving the world that doesn&rsquo;t include your mental illness. People are different, they can and can&rsquo;t do different things. A goal for one person to be completely healed from depression might just simply not be in the cards for others. <em>However</em>: Even temporary relief or a more manageable severity of symptoms might be totally worth the effort.</p>\n<p>Finally, there is no relief in thinking that you may never find relief and therefore doing nothing. I would like to say: Whole-ass the thing, but I don&rsquo;t mean it to say &ldquo;don&rsquo;t do anything else&rdquo;, I mean it in the sense that if you&rsquo;re doing therapy, take it seriously, treat is as a creative task.

You may want to add an extra comment to those here and there, or an extra thing, like an observation for stuff that didn&rsquo;t get logged in the dailies but is deemed important enough to be remarked upon for the weekly.</li>\n<li>This pattern of taking the most important stuff from the dailies and putting it into the weeklies is repeated for each periodic note: The monthlies get populated by the weeklies, the quarterlies by the monthlies and the yearlies by the quarterlies. The most important stuff gets distilled even more the longer the timespan is the note covers. In this way the workload is kept relatively small, although the first round of wrap-ups every year can take a while, since you have to do a weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly wrap-up all at the same time. But even then: It shouldn&rsquo;t take longer than maybe an hour.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This little workflow is not too time intensive and at the same time gives me peace of mind: I do have a kind of journal of my life, which I can use to look back on what happened in my life.</p>\n<p>I have been more or less doing this kind of journaling for two years now and can really recommend it. A word to clarify something important though: A journal kept in this way is not going to be a literary delight. Individual thoughts and observations might rise to that level, but the journal as a whole is much more utilitarian. If this is not a problem and you&rsquo;d like the idea of distilling what&rsquo;s been important this might be for you.</p>\n",

You may want to add an extra comment to those here and there, or an extra thing, like an observation for stuff that didn't get logged in the dailies but is deemed important enough to be remarked upon for the weekly.\n5. This pattern of taking the most important stuff from the dailies and putting it into the weeklies is repeated for each periodic note: The monthlies get populated by the weeklies, the quarterlies by the monthlies and the yearlies by the quarterlies. The most important stuff gets distilled even more the longer the timespan is the note covers. In this way the workload is kept relatively small, although the first round of wrap-ups every year can take a while, since you have to do a weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly wrap-up all at the same time. But even then: It shouldn't take longer than maybe an hour.\n\nThis little workflow is not too time intensive and at the same time gives me peace of mind: I do have a kind of journal of my life, which I can use to look back on what happened in my life.\n\nI have been more or less doing this kind of journaling for two years now and can really recommend it. A word to clarify something important though: A journal kept in this way is not going to be a literary delight. Individual thoughts and observations might rise to that level, but the journal as a whole is much more utilitarian. If this is not a problem and you'd like the idea of distilling what's been important this might be for you.\n",

At the same time having a dog is challenging. My family lives about 2000 km away. My partner&rsquo;s family lives about 800 km away.

Daily life with a dog is great, but it&rsquo;s not a neutral thing either: A dog warrants attention, love, decision making and so many different things. Your life will change and it will revolve around the dog a lot.

I take this as a great sign that we are truly there for each other - through thick and thin. It was not an easy year. Lots of emotional support was needed. I&rsquo;m happy to say that I was able to give it, when I could. As an introvert - yep, that&rsquo;s true even when it comes to my partner - it wasn&rsquo;t always an easy thing to do, but I can look at myself in the mirror and honestly say that I tried hard in this regard. And I won&rsquo;t only complain, either: The vast vast VAST majority of our time together has been fun and something to look forward to. I love sharing my life with my favorite person and love having lots of memorable moments together.</p>\n<p>I have become a little rounder last year. Maybe two or three kilos - or is it five? A little grayer, too. I&rsquo;m 36 now. I feel like I&rsquo;m fine with my age and my looks. &ldquo;Not having anything to show for the effort&rdquo;-itis (see above) is surely a sign of getting older, I think and I do recognize that I&rsquo;m not super young anymore, but getting older is not worrying me. That&rsquo;s good. I think.</p>\n<p>So what will I remember from 2022? Our engagement for sure. How I got sick of grand plans maybe? That 2022 was economically a terrible year and I&rsquo;m happy that we were not too hard hit? Maybe that I tried hard on many occasions, despite any track record or tangible results?</p>\n<p>Maybe I will remember this year as a kind of beacon, like from a light house: On the one hand I had some insights that will surely inform my decision making next year. On the other hand, I came close at times to run aground in the shoals of actual lived adulthood. I have to be careful, but I also want to take heart: I&rsquo;m looking as ever hopeful into the future.

As an introvert - yep, that's true even when it comes to my partner - it wasn't always an easy thing to do, but I can look at myself in the mirror and honestly say that I tried hard in this regard. And I won't only complain, either: The vast vast VAST majority of our time together has been fun and something to look forward to. I love sharing my life with my favorite person and love having lots of memorable moments together.\n\nI have become a little rounder last year. Maybe two or three kilos - or is it five? A little grayer, too. I'm 36 now. I feel like I'm fine with my age and my looks. \"Not having anything to show for the effort\"-itis (see above) is surely a sign of getting older, I think and I do recognize that I'm not super young anymore, but getting older is not worrying me. That's good. I think.\n\nSo what will I remember from 2022? Our engagement for sure. How I got sick of grand plans maybe? That 2022 was economically a terrible year and I'm happy that we were not too hard hit? Maybe that I tried hard on many occasions, despite any track record or tangible results?\n\nMaybe I will remember this year as a kind of beacon, like from a light house: On the one hand I had some insights that will surely inform my decision making next year. On the other hand, I came close at times to run aground in the shoals of actual lived adulthood. I have to be careful, but I also want to take heart: I'm looking as ever hopeful into the future. Maybe I'm able to not only claim a realistic approach next year but actually live one also.\n\n- Yearly Reviews\n  - [Previously](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/01/01/year-of-strain.html)\n  - [Forward](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/01/04/this-year-had.html)\n- Duolingo\n  - [Previously](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2021/12/13/cool.html)\n  - [Forward](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/04/11/days-of-duolingo.html)\n",

When I scrolled through their explore timeline I was surprised to find a post by fellow corgi lover and micro.blogger Hollie Butler (<a href=\"https://micro.blog/hollie\">@hollie</a>) that urged people to find a better instance, because mastodon.social has had a bad moderation for a long time.</p>\n<p>In the replies to this post a user asked: Can I move my content over to a new (e.g. better moderated) instance? The answer is no. You can move the people you follow, but not your content, it seems.</p>\n<p>With micro.blog this combination of problems doesn't really exist. On the one hand they have and enforce community guidelines that protect the community against hate speech, harassment and so on. Community manager Jean MacDonald (<a href=\"https://micro.blog/jean\">@jean</a>) does an excellent job as far as I can tell. So there is no reason to move. Micro.blog is just a blog hoster with a social timeline component.</p>\n<p>On the other hand exporting your data is easy enough, too. Even if there would be a reason at some point to move: I do own all my content and it's not useless content, because a micro.blog is just a blog and so the content I'd export are just blog posts.</p>\n<p>The point is: At the moment micro.blog seems like the ideal place that is not twitter, but has moderation figured out (and still lets you connect to mastodon users). I feel like I'm in good hands with them. If you're willing to fiddle, you can connect your own blog for free, or you could pay them 5$ a month and have everything set up for you. Connect a domain and you really truly own your content, even in the case you feel the need to move away, since the permalinks point to your domain not micro.blog's (<a href=\"https://help.micro.blog/t/moving-micro-blog-hosted-blog-to-self-hosted/1201\">I'm not claiming the moving blog hosters is easy, but it's possible…</a>).</p>\n",

Wether it is note taking or coding, gaming or just watching youtube: I really like to use my Mac more than I like my iPad. The iPad is strictly better for cooking and is used frequently for that, but I have not used the machine to its full potential. I have noticed that I'm a very stationary person and like my current desk setup (private laptop on the left, KVM-enabled Display in the middle, work laptop on the right, <a href=\"https://ergodox-ez.com/\">Ergodox EZ</a> as my keyboard and Logitech MX Master 3 as my mouse), which doesn't include a real place for an iPad. I rarely work on the kitchen table - the only other spot really usable for writing/sitting down to do computer things in my home. Even when I'm traveling it's the laptop not the tablet that gets used.</p>\n<p>That being said I'm happy about owning an iPad Pro, too. I use it frequently enough to make it worth the purchase, even if I'm a light user of it. Next time around I probably would get a cheaper, more basic model. The Air is just plainly a great computer and I can't even conceive a justification for wanting more out of a private computer (which gets used for 1 to 8 hours a day, depending on if it's the weekend or free time after work).</p>\n",

I didn’t “live” in my notes as much as I like to do.</p>\n<p>Another big reason for being fine with paying the price of maintaining things myself is the recent development of Obsidian: it now supports multiple windows, something that Agenda lacks and something that makes distilling a bunch of notes into a new one pretty hard.</p>\n<p>Finally, I think that working on plugins for Obsidian is a way to lessen the load of maintenance and - since I’m a developer - a way to actually gain some expertise. So in my case, it is not a terrible investment of time and effort.</p>\n<p> </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>The best feature is one that is provided and maintained by the platform. A feature that can be built using an API or through extensions/plugins is of course better than a feature that does not exist all. But: Building a feature means maintaining a feature.</p>\n<p>An example: You can cobble together a functioning journaling/project notes solution, with daily, weekly and other periodic notes in <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/02/27/good-apps-obsidian.html\">Obsidian</a> (using a handful of plugins and a carefully thought through file organization scheme). That works. You just have to remember how everything works the next time you touch that part of your setup. And hope that nothing breaks, between those loosely coupled building blocks and the next update. Or you could just use <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/08/22/good-apps-agenda.html\">Agenda</a>. Is Agenda perfect? No. But it is much more well suited out of the box for this kind of note taking.</p>\n<p>There is also a risk of drift: If you're trying to organize your notes, you probably don't do so just for the sake of it, but because you try to become better at doing other things. The notes and also the notes setup are just helping to accomplish a task at hand. If your setup is complicated and some parts are even written by yourself, you might end up accomplishing everything else but the task you set out to check off in the first place.</p>\n<p>Therefore, when I try to improve my current system, I always look for ways to use a less customized system. The more stock features I use the better. The burden of maintaining those features lies with the app developer.</p>\n<p>Of course, there will be lots of cases where a feature just doesn't exist. In that case I try to live without this feature first. Maybe I don't need it as much as I first thought. If I can't live without it, I look for a plugin solution, again, to lessen the maintenance load on myself. I have to be aware, that I may not need to maintain the plugin providing the feature, but I am now responsible to make it all work, i.e. the burden of maintenance of the integration of plugin and setup lies with me.</p>\n<p>Finally, I might write a plugin, script or customize an existing piece of code to make it do what I need it to do, but this is really a last resort. Very often this is not worth the time.</p>\n",

These are often literally the base of knowledge from which I work. Here I try to distill what I have learned and try to push myself toward the new and the more generalized.</li>\n<li>Project notes: Status quos, todos and thoughts related to ongoing projects or tasks that have some kind of momentum but are more ephemeral than timeless notes.</li>\n<li>Journal notes: Notes that record what is happening or has happened so that I have a written record of aspects of my lived life.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Types 2 and 3 are very much related, although different in the sense, that a type 2 note is not necessarily interesting enough to be mentioned in a type 3 note. And a type 3 note is not so concerned with creating or maintaining momentum, but more with creating a record of what happened.</p>\n<p>Type one notes are different in the sense that they should be more interlinked and add up to trees of notes that in turn act serendipity-enhancing on the interface between thinking and writing (including coding). You want to treat those kinds of notes differently and keep them separate. This is where the good stuff lives. Insights from type 2 and 3 notes might end up becoming a type 1 note.</p>\n<p>A type 1 note is not the place to keep a record, though. It represents my latest stance on a topic, the latest formulation of an idea. They exist to be refactored and to be changed in any way that seems appropriate.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I work as a programmer for my day job. Right now I am working on two php projects. Coming from <a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com\">Sublime Text</a> but having had the need for more IDE features I came to love <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com\">Visual Studio Code</a> and made it my home. VS Code is a great editor for PHP development, especially if you use the <a href=\"https://intelephense.com\">Intelephense</a> extension. However, the bigger the project, the more it becomes apparent, that the performance of the language server is not <em>that</em> great.</p>\n<p>I lived with this for many months now. Yesterday I started working on a new issue and thought to myself: “All of my dev team members use <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/\">Jetbrains PHPStorm</a>, I should give it a try.”. I had used <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/\">Jetbrains Intelij Idea</a> for a brief moment a while back and only remembered being fairly unimpressed, but not exactly why I felt that way. Having now tried getting into their PHP IDE product, I have to say my impression has not really changed and now I also remember why.</p>\n<p>Although the code intelligence performance is clearly better, it is the small stuff that gets me. The impetus for this post for example was that you can’t use standard shell shortcuts with the integrated terminal: <code>Control + R</code> (backwards history search) being one of my most often used commands.</p>\n<p>I appreciated that they offer a keymap for people coming from Code to PHPStorm and as far as I can tell, the commands in it work. But customizing an IDE is more than just having the same default shortcuts for common tasks available in the new app. I have a bunch of my own shortcuts in code that use the pattern <code>CMD + H &lt;Key&gt;</code> (press <code>CMD + H</code> and then <code>&lt;Key&gt;</code>). I use <code>CMD + H</code>, because my last name start with H, so it was (and is) easier to remember. It just so happens that <code>CMD + H</code> is also a system wide shortcut for hiding an application. So when I tried to set up a frequently used shortcut to reveal the currently opened file in the sidebar navigation, <code>CMD + H S</code> the PHPStorm app was just hidden. In other words it did not “shadow” or override system shortcuts when asked. This feels even more arbitrary if we take those two things together: On the one hand standard shortcuts of the shell running inside the integrated terminal are shadowed per default - and this can also not be disabled -  and on the other hand wanting to shadow a system wide shortcut like <code>CMD + H</code> is not possible without remapping the shortcut within the OS. I feel like the IDE is not really playing along, but instead makes me jump through hoops.</p>\n<p>These are only two compounding cuts of a thousand that make PHPStorm hard to love in my opinion. I have an especially hard time understanding the design decisions to remove long standing functionality from a shell by shadowing standard shortcuts. It’s just a bad idea. It does explain why my colleagues never use the integrated terminal, but have an extra shell window open to the side, to run terminal commands.</p>\n<p>All in all I am very unimpressed by PHPStorm, but also worried: If the performance of Intelephense stays as bad much longer, I might have to look at other options. I know that Netbeans and Eclipse also have PHP features, I just don’t know anyone using, let alone loving these apps for PHP development…</p>\n\n[Forward.](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2023/07/10/phpstorms-keybinding-system.html)\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I recently bought new hardware for my personal use: An M1 MacBook Air and an 11” iPad Pro. My thoughts after the keynote:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I couldn’t be more excited about the new iPadOS features</li>\n<li>I am slightly sad that the two new MacBook models - the new M2 MacBook Air and the new 13-inch MacBook Pro - would have been options for my needs and budget</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since the iPad Pro was supposed to be my main machine - not least because I wanted to see if that is possible and fun - I’m even more excited to double down on that. Yeah, I just bought the older MacBook Air, but I bought it because I assume that the light coding I’m doing in my free time and the heavier reading/writing/note taking/processing workflow I have, will lead me to use a machine that can run a less walled in OS with multitasking capabilities. We’ll see.</p>\n<p>I wonder if I would have picked a beefier M2 Air over my two machine solution, but I’m also happy I got both devices. We live in a time of exciting technology in which we can pick the right digital tool for the job at hand and I’m happy that I can experience this exciting future.</p>\n<p>In any case: My new hardware - I’m still waiting on my new Air - is/is going to be an amazing upgrade to my technological status quo. My personal laptop has been a 13-inch Mac Pro from 2013. And although that computer is still working (I just upgraded it to Monterey this morning!), it was time to upgrade. I’m really looking forward to leaving the sluggish, syrupy Mac experience behind.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/10/24/previously-after-using.html\">My thoughts after a few months of use</a></p>\n",

It is an event that can interact with me and potentially makes me do things. It’s a trigger (or cue).</p>\n<p>Notifications can be desirable, overwhelming, unhelpful or outright spam. They are not inherently good or bad, but they are not a neutral thing in the world either: They make a difference.</p>\n<p>Judging the usefulness of a notification is a involved process. The complexity of getting notifications right increases when realizing that you have to set them up beforehand, which means you have to expect the future.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1.whatdoyounotwanttomiss-notwantingtomisssomethingdoesn’tmeanyouneedtoknowaboutitimmediately.\">1.

A window of obligation/opportunity opened (or is about to close). Something was like <em>this</em> now it’s like <em>that</em>. Depending on the change, I might be interested in it forever or only for a limited period. In either case, time sensitivity itself is not the same as a change of state.

How time sensitive is it? - Time sensitivity is not the same as the importance of the change occurring or the importance of the new status quo.</h3>\n<p>Time sensitivity doesn’t mean any change of state needs to be known now. Sometimes it needs to be known depending on a location or on a certain date and time. “Now” is one, but not the only possibility. The reasons for a notification being time sensitive can be manifold in practice. Abstractly speaking, it is a question of priority and urgency - which are also not the same thing.</p>\n<p>Whilst priority is trying to rank items by importance (which itself is a relative measure of impactfulness of the thing in question) to my world, urgency re-ranks those items according to currently open windows of opportunity and/or obligation.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Not only is it hard to keep all these distinctions in mind when I’m trying to predict my future, I’m also prone to getting it wrong, because my world is not made of numbers.

So I try that first for any app that actually really needs to inform me.</p>\n<p>The harder part of this heuristic is figuring out what the least distracting thing is. I find a badge count of the right measure to be pretty good.

				"content_text": "<p>I recently published a post about my <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/05/15/my-microcasts.html\">microcasts</a> and I‘m now writing this to tell you I’m going to microcast less. Less frequent and less scheduled. This is even weirder because I just created an intricate shortcut that automatically publishes a post with the right episode title and number without having to look up any of those details, which streamlined the entire process a lot.</p>\n\n<p>But I have noticed that I‘m not as much in the mood at the moment to record my thoughts in this way. <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/categories/the-early-riser/\">The early riser project</a>, for example, was a great McGuffin to get me out of bed, but since I have changed my approach to waking up, it has become less important to me. I don‘t want to record these little episodes for the ramblings alone.</p>\n\n<p>Being a big fan of podcasts like <a href=\"https://www.backtowork.limo\">Back To Work</a> and <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/cortex\">Cortex</a>, I thought I could do a microcast about my work and how I approach it, but I have noticed that I would like to write about these things, not only talk about them extemporaenously. LeadDev is also the microcast for which the ratio of recorded/published episodes is the worst: I take this as an indicator of my wanting to express myself more carefully than I can while walking the dog and having to observe the environment.</p>\n\n<p>À propos the dog: I created my first microcast, the PuppyCast, because I wanted to have a record of the challenges and joys of raising a puppy. I wanted to look (<a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/categories/dailydogo/\">DailyDoogo</a>, which I will not abandon, btw.) and listen back to this important time in my life. But I think that this project has run its course: I don‘t feel the need to publish this every week anymore. It‘s not like nothing changes or that there is nothing to report dog-wise, but it all comes down to the need to simplify and de-schedule my life. And I have episodes for the first six months, which seems like a good place to stop.</p>\n\n<p>Seasons change. And this is how I feel about my microcasting: Right now I‘d much rather write than talk. Looking at my blog I mostly see noise that was produced hastily to satisfy a self-imposed schedule. I will let this stuff go, for now.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><a href=\"https://obsidian.md\">Obsidian</a> is a personal knowledge base and note taking app with a lot of flexibility and extensions that make it very powerful. If you like to <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/01/23/notes-on-notes.html\">take notes</a> and be in control of your data, then Obsidian might be the right fit.</p>\n<p>What makes Obsidian so valuable for me is that it allows me to consolidate a lot of things into one app. Like information about a project and its tasks. Reference materials about sociology and solutions to programming problems. Everything can be made to fit into Obsidian and thanks to its extensibility and configurability, the app can be adapted to my evolving needs over time.</p>\n<p>Most people point out that Obsidian is an app for people who like to <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/01/23/103518.html\">link their notes together</a>. If you rename a note in Obsidian, all the links to it will be renamed, too. Linking notes, so that they become chains and/or trees of notes unlocks emergent qualities that you wouldn’t be able to access without linking them.<a id=\"fnref:1\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"see footnote\" href=\"#fn:1\">[1]</a> It is also available as an iPhone app, that can do almost all the things that the Mac app can do. So you can take all your stuff with you as well.</p>\n<p>Obsidian might not be for you, because it might just be a little bit too much. But it might also just be the tool you were looking for. If you happen to have a tendency to react skeptically to overly hyped apps like this one: Ignore the knowledge graph visualization stuff<a id=\"fnref:2\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"see footnote\" href=\"#fn:2\">[2]</a> and also the personal knowledge base singularity talk and just try it out. Obsidian is great.

				"content_text": "<p>In January I did a yearly Review and planning session, a thing I always try to do every year.</p>\n\n<p>This year I have the following goals and ideas which I'd like to try out:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Becoming an early riser - Status Quo: Big success! So much more time<sup><a href=\"#fn1-22434\" id=\"fnr1-22434\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> to do my projects. Se also my unter two minutes podcast <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/categories/the-early-riser/\">\"The Early Riser\"</a> that I record every single morning right after I have woken up.</li>\n<li>\"I will start\" - Explanation: Be the one who initiates communication, anticipate things to do before anybody has to bring them up - Status: Eh. Could be better, but I am not so bothered by this.</li>\n<li>Evidence-based living - Explanation: <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/01/19/080216.html\">Track things</a> and find metrics to make more informed decisions about different areas in my life.</li>\n<li>\"Commit\" - Explanation: Inspired by <a href=\"https://www.oliverburkeman.com/books\">4000 Weeks</a>, I'll try to commit to only three work-in-progress items at a time and if I'm committed try to bring those things to an end that is satisfactory while also resisting other demands - internally or externally - on me and my time and attention. Status: Okay, actually.</li>\n<li>\"Read and Write more\" - Status: Meh. I am trying, though. I found that playing around with <a href=\"https://readwise.io\">Readwise</a><sup><a href=\"#fn2-22434\" id=\"fnr2-22434\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> has motivated me to do more in this regard.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-22434\">\n<p>A day has only 24 Hours, so how is changing the start of the day making a difference? It's all about not snoozing and using time in bed effectively. If you need 10 hours in bed to get 6 hours of sleep that's not very effective. On the other hand: If you sleep 7 hours while laying in bed for 8 that's pretty good. Changing my sleep schedule made me a more effective sleeper. <a href=\"#fnr1-22434\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn2-22434\">\n<p>I can't decide if it's a great thing or overpriced, yet. [EDIT: <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/02/13/my-current-highlighting.html\">I have decided that I like it. A lot.</a>] But I have noticed the little boost of interest of doing more reading (and re-reading) with every resurfaced highlight. So maybe it'll end up being worth it. <a href=\"#fnr2-22434\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

Think of it as an app that lets you create counters that can be named, categorized and - if you are a plus member - specified by using attributes. Finally they can be displayed in a variety of ways. An example: I track my dog&rsquo;s pees and poops in Daytum. The items are called pees and poops respectively. The category for both of them is dog in this case. And each have an entry attribute - to be filled - every time you add an entry, called: where, which has two options (inside and outside).

Think of it as an app that lets you create counters that can be named, categorized and - if you are a plus member - specified by using attributes. Finally they can be displayed in a variety of ways. An example: I track my dog's pees and poops in Daytum. The items are called pees and poops respectively. The category for both of them is dog in this case. And each have an entry attribute - to be filled - every time you add an entry, called: where, which has two options (inside and outside). Here is a couple of example displays for the last day:\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/44388/2022/cc40f5b35e.png)\n\nThe plus membership is dirt cheap: Only USD18 a year.

Effortlessness does only exist in a certain, unrealistic, frame.\n\n[^1]: This implies that most if not all things I want to do are ongoing goals, not projects, which is true. Projects are only a step or part of an overarching ongoing goal to me.\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I barely can watch movies anymore. This has less to do with problems of changing aesthetics and me being unable to adapt (, although maybe a little bit). It’s more about it getting harder and harder to suspend my disbelief. An example from last night: I tried to watch „Don’t look up“ but got so infuriated by the depiction of how things would supposedly work, that I couldn’t enjoy an otherwise interesting idea. I guess I just don’t like when a movie’s plotting is dependent on unrealistic premises, especially when it claims to start from a place of (somewhat heightened) realism. Things should make sense within the confines of its world. If our actual world builds the backbone of the movie’s world then you gotta show the work that’s happening why things are different than we normally would expect them to be. Show me the work. This is not the same as asking for everything to be explained. I am simply asking for potential plausibility. Handwaving in the right spots is of course part of storytelling.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe it’s because I have studied history of science and technology, have been working in the literature studies department while I was studying and am now working as a programmer that I am therefore primed to notice and dislike such inconsistencies. I prefer nonfiction, memoirs and sociologically interesting sci-fi. Works that do not reduce the interesting complexities of our world to tell a story that doesn’t shy away from the effort to be plausible.</p>\n\n<p>I think that this happens to me more frequently now, is because I am much more time- and attention-constrained. I do not have the resources after a long day to consume too many things that ask me to do the work of „making it work“. I also have less chances to consume anything at all the older I get and the more responsibilities I have and am therefore more discerning on what I spend my time on. „Tried and true“ is often the answer. So no wonder that watching sports have become such a big part of my life instead of artistic works. I also prefer a solid but consistent tv show over an at times brilliant but otherwise disappointing one. I assess consuming media more and more from a standpoint of how risky it is: How likely will I be disappointed? I already have lists of lists of things I would like to do. If I decide to try something new, it better be worth it. And: It seldom is.</p>\n\n<p>There is a ratcheting effect built in this way of consuming media: You do more and more of the same and less and less of the new. If it was only me I would even prefer such a bias, but it also has consequences for enjoying things like movies and tv shows together with my partner. So I end up giving chances to things I would have not considered. Maybe that’s good. Things shouldn’t be too predictable either. But boy, do many, many things suffer from a lack of plausibility…</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>As I said in <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2021/07/17/the-art-of.html\">my last review</a>: I love autobiographical writing. To continue the theme, I recently listened to Joan Didion&rsquo;s Books: The Year of Magical Thinking and Let Me Tell You What I Mean.</p>\n<p>The Year of Magical Thinking is a memoir of an especially tumultuous year in her life. After the sudden death of her husband and the hospitalization of her daughter, Didion finds herself detached from reality and has to claw herself back to reason. There is a certain sharpness in the way she puts things, a certain breathlessness in the intelligence with which she follows the paths of her own thoughts while mourning the loss of a writing partner and spouse (a parallel to Hampl&rsquo;s book).</p>\n<p>We see here a woman who is smart, quick and in control of her faculties wanting to fight and having to accept, that there is no real shortcut, no swift way to skip the all too human need to just feel shitty for a while, to be scared, to be upset, to not know, to maybe not even understand why your own seemingly better argument, the pointed question or educated guess doesn&rsquo;t cut it. To be clear, what Didion focusses on is not this desire to skip the lowly emotions and loss of control that are part of the human condition. But, to me, she exemplifies how hard it is to accept the necessity of being a passenger, not the driver, for a while after an event like this.</p>\n<p>One strength of Didion&rsquo;s writing is that she can put a finger on the power of slightly changed emphases. Like in her text &ldquo;Everywoman.com&rdquo; about Martha Stewart and her empire from the second book of her&rsquo;s I have listened to: Let Me Tell You What I Mean, a collection of essays from 1968 to 2000.</p>\n<p>In Everywoman.com she turns the critique on Martha Stewart, a home maker turned CEO of a billion dollar company, inside out. The critique goes something like this: Martha Stewart is a fraud, because she pretends to be a simple homemaker, like her fans, even though in reality she is a driven business woman who created merely an artifice of being a homemaker. Didion is directing her more empathetic read of Stewart mainly against Jerry Oppenheimer&rsquo;s unauthorized investigative Book on her: Just Desserts. Opposed to Oppenheimer, Didion concludes that Stewart&rsquo;s success, Artifice and all, are inspirational to US-American women because Stewart managed to create her own rags to riches story: from homemaker to CEO.</p>\n<p>One thing I picked up and that is eerily related to her empathy for Stewart is her own success. I stumbled upon the following <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2XO43HUDM9UHF/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=1400078431\">review of The Year of Magical Thinking on Amazon</a> that is an example of what I mean:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>She certainly went through losses that would make anyone stagger. I just found that I couldn&rsquo;t identify with her experiences. She describes months of folks making sure she was taken care of. Can&rsquo;t relate. She recounts good times in a long marriage that involves luxurious travels and freedom gained through wealth. Can&rsquo;t relate. Am I jealous? Probably.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Didion is well off, that much is clear. She has been a successful writer for a long time and coming up in a much more socially mobile era, she ended up being wealthy. The question is: Does this take away from her writing? And the answer is: Yes, a little bit. I wouldn&rsquo;t go so far to suggest that I can&rsquo;t relate or that what she has to say is not interesting, quiet the opposite, but because Didion&rsquo;s voice is one of careful reexamination (it reminds of the idiom &ldquo;show me, I&rsquo;m from Missouri&rdquo;) and her reputation is one of popularizing counter culture, of problematizing the American Dream I can&rsquo;t deny that the success, although earned, subverts a little bit her persona, her self-conception or the frame from which I read her (so maybe, probably, this is on me). It complicates the relationship between me, the reader (or listener in my case), and her, the counter culture writer. Now, I am not owed an uncomplicated relationship. But I do have to admit that the contrast of a now wealthy writer that came from a place of socially conscious reporting - and still has those instincts but lives a totally different life - lead to some cognitive dissonance. It totally makes sense that lives like this exist. She is not the first, nor the last that will have had also monetary success from writing empathetically about various social issues. I still enjoyed the books, I just wish there was a way to ask the question: How do you integrate your being well off with writing so empathetically? How do you try to juggle not being perceived as patronizing?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can find her Essay on Martha Stewart on the New Yorker&rsquo;s website: <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2000/02/21/everywoman-com\">Everywoman.com</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n",

But, to me, she exemplifies how hard it is to accept the necessity of being a passenger, not the driver, for a while after an event like this.\n\nOne strength of Didion's writing is that she can put a finger on the power of slightly changed emphases. Like in her text \"Everywoman.com\" about Martha Stewart and her empire from the second book of her's I have listened to: Let Me Tell You What I Mean, a collection of essays from 1968 to 2000.\n\nIn Everywoman.com she turns the critique on Martha Stewart, a home maker turned CEO of a billion dollar company, inside out. The critique goes something like this: Martha Stewart is a fraud, because she pretends to be a simple homemaker, like her fans, even though in reality she is a driven business woman who created merely an artifice of being a homemaker. Didion is directing her more empathetic read of Stewart mainly against Jerry Oppenheimer's unauthorized investigative Book on her: Just Desserts. Opposed to Oppenheimer, Didion concludes that Stewart's success, Artifice and all, are inspirational to US-American women because Stewart managed to create her own rags to riches story: from homemaker to CEO.\n\nOne thing I picked up and that is eerily related to her empathy for Stewart is her own success. I stumbled upon the following [review of The Year of Magical Thinking on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2XO43HUDM9UHF/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400078431) that is an example of what I mean:\n\n>She certainly went through losses that would make anyone stagger. I just found that I couldn't identify with her experiences. She describes months of folks making sure she was taken care of. Can't relate. She recounts good times in a long marriage that involves luxurious travels and freedom gained through wealth. Can't relate. Am I jealous? Probably.\n\nDidion is well off, that much is clear. She has been a successful writer for a long time and coming up in a much more socially mobile era, she ended up being wealthy. The question is: Does this take away from her writing? And the answer is: Yes, a little bit. I wouldn't go so far to suggest that I can't relate or that what she has to say is not interesting, quiet the opposite, but because Didion's voice is one of careful reexamination (it reminds of the idiom \"show me, I'm from Missouri\") and her reputation is one of popularizing counter culture, of problematizing the American Dream I can't deny that the success, although earned, subverts a little bit her persona, her self-conception or the frame from which I read her (so maybe, probably, this is on me). It complicates the relationship between me, the reader (or listener in my case), and her, the counter culture writer. Now, I am not owed an uncomplicated relationship. But I do have to admit that the contrast of a now wealthy writer that came from a place of socially conscious reporting - and still has those instincts but lives a totally different life - lead to some cognitive dissonance. It totally makes sense that lives like this exist. She is not the first, nor the last that will have had also monetary success from writing empathetically about various social issues. I still enjoyed the books, I just wish there was a way to ask the question: How do you integrate your being well off with writing so empathetically? How do you try to juggle not being perceived as patronizing?\n\n- You can find her Essay on Martha Stewart on the New Yorker's website: [Everywoman.com](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2000/02/21/everywoman-com).\n",

				"content_html": "<p>When I was looking through my DayOne posts - the recent acquisition of the journaling app by automattic made me curious; I had not been using the app in a couple of years - I stumbled upon a journal entry that included a few screenshots of tweets that a quite popular German political Twitterer (maybe 30k followers back then, now around 50k followers) had posted, that berated me fiercely. How stupid I was and how dare I speak up against this person. They called me a baboon that needed to be put into place amongst other things. I think they called me sexist, too. I didn&rsquo;t have the heart to plunge deeper into the post. As I was simply too shocked. I had completely forgotten about this life altering experience half a decade ago. But here it was. And the remembering began.</p>\n<p>What had happened? When I was studying history of science and technology I was not shy to speak up. I was a young man that deemed himself smart and with a talent for research. I also had way too much time on my hands, which made me &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; in class. I read and studied furiously. And what I learned I wanted to apply. That is, nothing went past me in class. Any little uncertainty that came up, I problematized - to the frustration of my professors, I&rsquo;m sure, as well as my classmates. I wanted to be a researcher, or no, I wanted to be a prodigy. A person with great potential to become an exceptional researcher. I dreamt big. And I wanted my professors to see how smart I was. I had this dream that somebody would take me under their wing, make me behave, by offering a path to a career in research. I wanted to be tamed, I think, so that I could become the beautiful, creative researcher that I thought I ought to be.</p>\n<p>In any case, this phase of my life was a messy one and so were the discussions in the seminars. Lots of arguments, lots and lots of monologuing on my part. Oh, my poor classmates, forgive me! But that&rsquo;s who I was back then and although I look back with shame, I would be lying if I would not point out that this time of my life was one of the most instructive phases of it as well.</p>\n<p>I remember neither subject of the course nor the specific book introduction, chapter or article that we were assigned to read for this weeks class. What I do remember is that I disagreed vehemently with the author&rsquo;s premise that nobody had as of yet <em>really</em> looked into the topic at hand, except herself. That the author was female was incidental to my disagreement. But I never liked this take. To me, history was all about uncovering more and more aspects of the past. And a new take was adding a new shade, a new layer to the beautiful complexities of historiography as it related to the topic at hand. There is no singular fundamental take on history that subsumes all other takes - or at least not for long. History is best, I thought, if it was a humbling exercise, one in which your own strong opinions and values get somewhat relativized. History, to me, was a quest for authenticity, for serious inquiry, that ought not to bend to the political fashions of the day - even if I happen to agree with them. History ought to be historicist, in the German sense, where the understanding of a happening stems from a process of trying to find plausibility in the actions through sympathy for the actors - no matter how vile their behavior would be deemed, probably rightfully so, in our time. In short I was a young man looking for authenticity in a world full of ironic takes. I craved sincerity. &ldquo;Be real with me&rdquo;, I thought often, &ldquo;I want to like you&rdquo;. &ldquo;I want to be sure that you like me&rdquo;, if you say so, too. I was lonely and longed for reliability.</p>\n<p>It was well known amongst history of science students back then, that we had a minor celebrity in our midst. This person was a young politician of some clout. An up-and-comer that had gotten a taste of political authority, of respect towards their own person, after being elected to the city&rsquo;s parliament. They were invited to talk shows and interviewed a few times for TV and radio back then. They carried the aura of demanding respect into our classroom as well. Wearing nice long woolen coats, good fitting suits and expensive looking scarfs, not at all what the rest of us normals wore and especially not me, the wild man in the shabby cloths. They were standing out. They had understood that clothes make the person. At the same time their public persona was one of irony, of trolling for the greater good, or what they perceived as the greater good. They were a postmodern politician. One that always seemed to play both sides of the un/certainty coin: Claiming &ldquo;Facts first!&rdquo; but being crowned troll of the year some years earlier.</p>\n<p>The actual quarrel around which I have been circulating for this handful of paragraphs is explained quickly: My adversary had read the text different than me - or not differently, but more affirmatively. The claim of a fundamental take did not repel them, quite the opposite. They bought the author&rsquo;s points about what others had overlooked, maybe they bought the idea of a perfect all-encompassing historical take as well? I wasn&rsquo;t sure back then, but I was sure that history doesn&rsquo;t bend to a totalitarian approach. Writing history is a process of picking and choosing, of simplification. So I argued against their notion, vehemently. That the author had a feminist viewpoint - which was so incidental to my points - became the linchpin of the discussion. To this day I am sure of this: Even a struggle so central to modern societal progress as equality can only ever be an aspect of historiography. You may base a whole career on feminist history - and that would be an important pursuit - but nobody would claim everything is said and done when we have told all there is to tell about this struggle. No. No! And again: No!</p>\n<p>I would like to claim that I stayed as calm as I am now, writing all this down however many years later, but that would be a lie. We shouted at each other. I didn&rsquo;t permit this person, or my professor for that matter, to have the last word. I was incapable to give in, to allow this person to lug his intimidating aura around to steamroll me. After all, this was academia! Or its impoverished simulacrum at least. And arguments ought to count more than any accomplishments in other arenas of society here. Finally, the person just left in the middle of the class, infuriated, slamming the door. I was about to make another remark about their bad attitude, but was silenced by my professor: &ldquo;Martin!&rdquo; He only shouted this one word. My name. &ldquo;Martin!&rdquo; &ldquo;There it was&rdquo;, I thought. Finally an acknowledgement. I felt oddly good. I felt put into place. And wasn&rsquo;t this what I wanted?

				"content_text": "When I was looking through my DayOne posts - the recent acquisition of the journaling app by automattic made me curious; I had not been using the app in a couple of years - I stumbled upon a journal entry that included a few screenshots of tweets that a quite popular German political Twitterer (maybe 30k followers back then, now around 50k followers) had posted, that berated me fiercely. How stupid I was and how dare I speak up against this person. They called me a baboon that needed to be put into place amongst other things. I think they called me sexist, too. I didn't have the heart to plunge deeper into the post. As I was simply too shocked. I had completely forgotten about this life altering experience half a decade ago. But here it was. And the remembering began.\n\nWhat had happened? When I was studying history of science and technology I was not shy to speak up. I was a young man that deemed himself smart and with a talent for research. I also had way too much time on my hands, which made me \"dangerous\" in class. I read and studied furiously. And what I learned I wanted to apply. That is, nothing went past me in class. Any little uncertainty that came up, I problematized - to the frustration of my professors, I'm sure, as well as my classmates. I wanted to be a researcher, or no, I wanted to be a prodigy. A person with great potential to become an exceptional researcher. I dreamt big. And I wanted my professors to see how smart I was. I had this dream that somebody would take me under their wing, make me behave, by offering a path to a career in research. I wanted to be tamed, I think, so that I could become the beautiful, creative researcher that I thought I ought to be.\n\nIn any case, this phase of my life was a messy one and so were the discussions in the seminars. Lots of arguments, lots and lots of monologuing on my part. Oh, my poor classmates, forgive me! But that's who I was back then and although I look back with shame, I would be lying if I would not point out that this time of my life was one of the most instructive phases of it as well.\n\nI remember neither subject of the course nor the specific book introduction, chapter or article that we were assigned to read for this weeks class. What I do remember is that I disagreed vehemently with the author's premise that nobody had as of yet *really* looked into the topic at hand, except herself. That the author was female was incidental to my disagreement. But I never liked this take. To me, history was all about uncovering more and more aspects of the past. And a new take was adding a new shade, a new layer to the beautiful complexities of historiography as it related to the topic at hand. There is no singular fundamental take on history that subsumes all other takes - or at least not for long. History is best, I thought, if it was a humbling exercise, one in which your own strong opinions and values get somewhat relativized. History, to me, was a quest for authenticity, for serious inquiry, that ought not to bend to the political fashions of the day - even if I happen to agree with them. History ought to be historicist, in the German sense, where the understanding of a happening stems from a process of trying to find plausibility in the actions through sympathy for the actors - no matter how vile their behavior would be deemed, probably rightfully so, in our time. In short I was a young man looking for authenticity in a world full of ironic takes. I craved sincerity. \"Be real with me\", I thought often, \"I want to like you\". \"I want to be sure that you like me\", if you say so, too. I was lonely and longed for reliability.\n\nIt was well known amongst history of science students back then, that we had a minor celebrity in our midst. This person was a young politician of some clout. An up-and-comer that had gotten a taste of political authority, of respect towards their own person, after being elected to the city's parliament. They were invited to talk shows and interviewed a few times for TV and radio back then. They carried the aura of demanding respect into our classroom as well. Wearing nice long woolen coats, good fitting suits and expensive looking scarfs, not at all what the rest of us normals wore and especially not me, the wild man in the shabby cloths. They were standing out. They had understood that clothes make the person. At the same time their public persona was one of irony, of trolling for the greater good, or what they perceived as the greater good. They were a postmodern politician. One that always seemed to play both sides of the un/certainty coin: Claiming \"Facts first!\" but being crowned troll of the year some years earlier.\n\nThe actual quarrel around which I have been circulating for this handful of paragraphs is explained quickly: My adversary had read the text different than me - or not differently, but more affirmatively. The claim of a fundamental take did not repel them, quite the opposite. They bought the author's points about what others had overlooked, maybe they bought the idea of a perfect all-encompassing historical take as well? I wasn't sure back then, but I was sure that history doesn't bend to a totalitarian approach. Writing history is a process of picking and choosing, of simplification. So I argued against their notion, vehemently. That the author had a feminist viewpoint - which was so incidental to my points - became the linchpin of the discussion. To this day I am sure of this: Even a struggle so central to modern societal progress as equality can only ever be an aspect of historiography. You may base a whole career on feminist history - and that would be an important pursuit - but nobody would claim everything is said and done when we have told all there is to tell about this struggle. No. No! And again: No!\n\nI would like to claim that I stayed as calm as I am now, writing all this down however many years later, but that would be a lie. We shouted at each other. I didn't permit this person, or my professor for that matter, to have the last word. I was incapable to give in, to allow this person to lug his intimidating aura around to steamroll me. After all, this was academia! Or its impoverished simulacrum at least. And arguments ought to count more than any accomplishments in other arenas of society here. Finally, the person just left in the middle of the class, infuriated, slamming the door. I was about to make another remark about their bad attitude, but was silenced by my professor: \"Martin!\" He only shouted this one word. My name. \"Martin!\" \"There it was\", I thought. Finally an acknowledgement. I felt oddly good. I felt put into place. And wasn't this what I wanted? To be put into place?\n\nA few hours later, still pumped up from the altercation, I learned that my opponent had posted the tweets they did. I don't think they assumed that I was a Twitter user or would seek ought their timeline - if they cared at all. I found myself in an exceptional situation: I could read what another person that didn't like me thought about me. They just had put it out there for anyone to read. That included me and their kinda big audience. Some people liked those tweets, others retweeted them. And even though I knew, intellectually, that these tweets weren't meant for me or were in the end about me, really (they were about this persons anger), I felt deeply hurt. I felt seen, in a bad way.
