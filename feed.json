				"title": "The Way We Use LLMs Makes All The Difference",
				"content_html": "<p>I am not using a lot of AI stuff. I do, however, have access to and use GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT since we are supposed to be using them at work. I am also totally aware of the problems (ethical, environmental, social, economical, &hellip;) that LLMs pose, thanks to Mastodon and my feed reader.</p>\n<p>So, being exposed to lots of AI stuff in practice and lots of critical (and sometimes not so critical) thought about using LLMs, I have observed a certain clarifying trend in my thinking about AI.</p>\n<p>But before we come to that, I have to frame my thoughts correctly.</p>\n<h4 id=\"living-virtuously\">Living virtuously</h4>\n<p>If I could decide, I would live virtuously, or rather, I would like to live in a world where using LLMs is a neutral-positive thing. However, if we think about it, nothing is neutral or positive, and everything has trade-offs. Everything has a cost.</p>\n<p>Owning a car has practical benefits but certainly has an impact on all kinds of things around us. Choosing to fly to see family has an impact. Living a privileged life in a Nordic country. Owning a dog. Wishing to own a freestanding house with a yard. Wanting to own a cottage, too. Wanting to travel. Wanting to refresh your hardware. Wishing to update our furniture. Wanting kids.</p>\n<p>Some of these things are socially acceptable wants/behaviors/possessions. Some of them have become more questionable in recent times. But I think it&rsquo;s important to recognize that a) none of these things are climate-neutral, without privilege and above ethical scrutiny, and b) none of these things (or other, equivalent things) are likely to be not wanted by at least some people, and we as citizens of a (western, democratic) society mostly make our peace with that, because changing attitudes towards these things is <em>hard</em>.</p>\n<p>And as much as we may recognize the costs associated with these things, we may want to have them ourselves anyways, too. So how could we criticize people for wanting them? Furthermore, we only have one life to live, and we are, in the end, not really able to transcend any and all societal wants and needs. Some we can, some we can&rsquo;t. Some will feel like natural, biological needs and wants, and we will feel justified in seeking fulfillment of those.</p>\n<p>And then there are others - mostly those we are able to let go - those will feel like optional luxuries we can choose to adopt/buy/whatever. And we may get mad at others for wanting them much more than us, even though we don&rsquo;t need them. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong: There will always be discourse around things like this. And things and values change, obviously, but there is another category of wants and needs that are socially unacceptable pretty much across the board: And these are taboos. Most things aren&rsquo;t taboos, though.</p>\n<p>And LLMs aren&rsquo;t either.</p>\n<h4 id=\"llms-from-my-viewpoint\">LLMs from my viewpoint</h4>\n<p>With that in mind, LLMs are not that different from other socially acceptable things out there. They are, however, a relatively new product/service category. They are not a new technology, just a new product (EDIT: However, I do use the shorthand of technology to refer to them in what follows). As is often the case with new &ldquo;technologies&rdquo; like this, We tend to ask of these technologies and of each other: what is an appropriate amount and type of use, and are they, after all, a net positive for society and me? I have two answers.</p>\n<p>For me, they are a positive in certain contexts. These contexts are those where what is generated can be easily validated. For me, so far, all of these contexts pertain to programming.</p>\n<p>LLMs help to paper over certain gaps in my knowledge, and they help with the busywork of programming by reducing the amount of boilerplate code I have to write by hand. If the code doesn&rsquo;t run, the generated code was wrong, and it&rsquo;s relatively easy to figure out what was wrong.</p>\n<p>AI can be a great rubber duck and boilerplate generator. In sum, programming with LLMs forms a great, tight feedback loop that makes coding more enjoyable and makes me feel more productive most of the time.</p>\n<p>I very rarely use it for anything not programming-related. I experimented with using it for ideation - my notes system is MUCH better at making me think interesting thoughts - and as a writing coach - but this just removed any writerly voice I had. I am personally not interested in using AI to generate texts, game systems or min/max anything (except maybe my programming).</p>\n<h4 id=\"llms-and-society\">LLMs and Society</h4>\n<p>For the societal viewpoint, on the other hand, it&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that society is not a person, and it doesn&rsquo;t make decisions. It doesn&rsquo;t have intentions, and you can&rsquo;t actually interact with it directly. So making demands on society doesn&rsquo;t make a lot of sense. It may make some sense to demand change from politicians, but politicians are not society.</p>\n<p>This text is not about changing society through political action, though. It is about exploring what could be a way to live within our current situation that neither loses sight of the complexities of life, by proclaiming a set of maxims, nor throws out the baby with the bath water, by being a cynical, egotistical jerk. The former leads to a kind of &ldquo;purity discourse&rdquo; that doesn&rsquo;t help any real person. If anything, it may make you feel bad, if you can&rsquo;t live up to the manifesto&rsquo;s demands. And the latter lives in a vacuum where nobody else matters, which is mostly sad and infuriating for anyone with a heart.</p>\n<p>So instead, I would want to explore what it would mean to live in a society that expects its members to live a certain way, and therefore its members tend to err on the side of fulfilling these expectations. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that if you fall short of society&rsquo;s expectations, you aren&rsquo;t a member anymore, just that its members may view you less favorably. But it has nothing to do with being in or out.</p>\n<p>People who fall far short of society&rsquo;s expectations, - e.g., those who commit crimes, may be punished for it. From fines to prison, being punished for bad behavior still doesn&rsquo;t make you not a part of a society. In other words, I am interested in figuring out a baseline expectation level towards the use of LLMs that you can at times overstep - as long as you don&rsquo;t go too far.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the question &ldquo;Are LLMs a positive for society?&rdquo; has to be restated as follows: Answer the question &ldquo;How would I like society to behave with regard to LLMs?&rdquo; and then live like a person who lives in a society that answers the question the same way.</p>\n<p>Note that I don&rsquo;t touch LLMs, the technology or product, at all. I can imagine LLMs being regulated, turned into a public good, or whatever, but that part is not in my control. Imagining things along the lines of how to change LLMs is therefore imagining the wrong thing for this purpose here.</p>\n<p>Here, we are interested in the citizens of a society to figure out a model of behavior we can follow that would work &ldquo;scaled up&rdquo; (that is, for more than just me or the privileged few). I don&rsquo;t want LLMs to be used for frivolous things - using water-guzzling LLM-APIs to water your own houseplants, is a real-life example I came across in recent months.</p>\n<p>But since I imagine myself living in a society that is cognizant of the associated costs of using LLMs, people would mostly not do these frivolous things with LLMs because it feels morally wrong to them. This scales well. We may here and there use LLMs for frivolous things, but we aren&rsquo;t overdoing it because we are not blind to its cost. And we wouldn&rsquo;t establish whole automation workflows based on LLM-APIs for automating watering our houseplants while the data centers running these LLM services are guzzling fresh water like nobody&rsquo;s business.</p>\n<p>I would want it to be used for beneficial use-cases like programming. By this I mean I would let LLMs help me generate boilerplate code and use it as an interactive rubber duck.

				"content_text": "I am not using a lot of AI stuff. I do, however, have access to and use GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT since we are supposed to be using them at work. I am also totally aware of the problems (ethical, environmental, social, economical, ...) that LLMs pose, thanks to Mastodon and my feed reader.\n\nSo, being exposed to lots of AI stuff in practice and lots of critical (and sometimes not so critical) thought about using LLMs, I have observed a certain clarifying trend in my thinking about AI.\n\nBut before we come to that, I have to frame my thoughts correctly.\n\n#### Living virtuously\n\nIf I could decide, I would live virtuously, or rather, I would like to live in a world where using LLMs is a neutral-positive thing. However, if we think about it, nothing is neutral or positive, and everything has trade-offs. Everything has a cost.\n\nOwning a car has practical benefits but certainly has an impact on all kinds of things around us. Choosing to fly to see family has an impact. Living a privileged life in a Nordic country. Owning a dog. Wishing to own a freestanding house with a yard. Wanting to own a cottage, too. Wanting to travel. Wanting to refresh your hardware. Wishing to update our furniture. Wanting kids.\n\nSome of these things are socially acceptable wants/behaviors/possessions. Some of them have become more questionable in recent times. But I think it's important to recognize that a) none of these things are climate-neutral, without privilege and above ethical scrutiny, and b) none of these things (or other, equivalent things) are likely to be not wanted by at least some people, and we as citizens of a (western, democratic) society mostly make our peace with that, because changing attitudes towards these things is _hard_.\n\nAnd as much as we may recognize the costs associated with these things, we may want to have them ourselves anyways, too. So how could we criticize people for wanting them? Furthermore, we only have one life to live, and we are, in the end, not really able to transcend any and all societal wants and needs. Some we can, some we can't. Some will feel like natural, biological needs and wants, and we will feel justified in seeking fulfillment of those.\n\nAnd then there are others - mostly those we are able to let go - those will feel like optional luxuries we can choose to adopt/buy/whatever. And we may get mad at others for wanting them much more than us, even though we don't need them. Don't get me wrong: There will always be discourse around things like this. And things and values change, obviously, but there is another category of wants and needs that are socially unacceptable pretty much across the board: And these are taboos. Most things aren't taboos, though.\n\nAnd LLMs aren't either.\n\n#### LLMs from my viewpoint\n\nWith that in mind, LLMs are not that different from other socially acceptable things out there. They are, however, a relatively new product/service category. They are not a new technology, just a new product (EDIT: However, I do use the shorthand of technology to refer to them in what follows). As is often the case with new \"technologies\" like this, We tend to ask of these technologies and of each other: what is an appropriate amount and type of use, and are they, after all, a net positive for society and me? I have two answers.\n\nFor me, they are a positive in certain contexts. These contexts are those where what is generated can be easily validated. For me, so far, all of these contexts pertain to programming.\n\nLLMs help to paper over certain gaps in my knowledge, and they help with the busywork of programming by reducing the amount of boilerplate code I have to write by hand. If the code doesn't run, the generated code was wrong, and it's relatively easy to figure out what was wrong.\n\nAI can be a great rubber duck and boilerplate generator. In sum, programming with LLMs forms a great, tight feedback loop that makes coding more enjoyable and makes me feel more productive most of the time.\n\nI very rarely use it for anything not programming-related. I experimented with using it for ideation - my notes system is MUCH better at making me think interesting thoughts - and as a writing coach - but this just removed any writerly voice I had. I am personally not interested in using AI to generate texts, game systems or min/max anything (except maybe my programming).\n\n#### LLMs and Society\n\nFor the societal viewpoint, on the other hand, it's important to keep in mind that society is not a person, and it doesn't make decisions. It doesn't have intentions, and you can't actually interact with it directly. So making demands on society doesn't make a lot of sense. It may make some sense to demand change from politicians, but politicians are not society.\n\nThis text is not about changing society through political action, though. It is about exploring what could be a way to live within our current situation that neither loses sight of the complexities of life, by proclaiming a set of maxims, nor throws out the baby with the bath water, by being a cynical, egotistical jerk. The former leads to a kind of \"purity discourse\" that doesn't help any real person. If anything, it may make you feel bad, if you can't live up to the manifesto's demands. And the latter lives in a vacuum where nobody else matters, which is mostly sad and infuriating for anyone with a heart.\n\nSo instead, I would want to explore what it would mean to live in a society that expects its members to live a certain way, and therefore its members tend to err on the side of fulfilling these expectations. This doesn't mean that if you fall short of society's expectations, you aren't a member anymore, just that its members may view you less favorably. But it has nothing to do with being in or out.\n\nPeople who fall far short of society's expectations, - e.g., those who commit crimes, may be punished for it. From fines to prison, being punished for bad behavior still doesn't make you not a part of a society. In other words, I am interested in figuring out a baseline expectation level towards the use of LLMs that you can at times overstep - as long as you don't go too far.\n\nTherefore, the question \"Are LLMs a positive for society?\" has to be restated as follows: Answer the question \"How would I like society to behave with regard to LLMs?\" and then live like a person who lives in a society that answers the question the same way.\n\nNote that I don't touch LLMs, the technology or product, at all. I can imagine LLMs being regulated, turned into a public good, or whatever, but that part is not in my control. Imagining things along the lines of how to change LLMs is therefore imagining the wrong thing for this purpose here.\n\nHere, we are interested in the citizens of a society to figure out a model of behavior we can follow that would work \"scaled up\" (that is, for more than just me or the privileged few). I don't want LLMs to be used for frivolous things - using water-guzzling LLM-APIs to water your own houseplants, is a real-life example I came across in recent months.\n\nBut since I imagine myself living in a society that is cognizant of the associated costs of using LLMs, people would mostly not do these frivolous things with LLMs because it feels morally wrong to them. This scales well. We may here and there use LLMs for frivolous things, but we aren't overdoing it because we are not blind to its cost. And we wouldn't establish whole automation workflows based on LLM-APIs for automating watering our houseplants while the data centers running these LLM services are guzzling fresh water like nobody's business.\n\nI would want it to be used for beneficial use-cases like programming. By this I mean I would let LLMs help me generate boilerplate code and use it as an interactive rubber duck. I don't mean that we would replace junior or mid-level developers (such as myself) with AI assistants. We would all know that it doesn't work in the first place. We may try to run small-scale experiments here and there to see if we could use AI as a developer replacement, but we wouldn't try to actually get rid of workers to make more profit.\n\nSince we are all into reading, writing and expressing ourselves through our unique voice and not through a statistical middle ground generator, we prefer and support people that express themselves by doing the hard work of actually doing so.\n\nWe would, however, try to stay open-minded. There may well be a time when an LLM can be beneficial for automating the rote parts of personal knowledge management, for example. So we may periodically try these things out.\n\nIn short, We would all stay curious about the technology's potential but would make sure that we were not building our whole lives around them. We wouldn't automate tasks with them that we don't have to and above all else, we would prefer a unique voice when expressing ideas, feelings, and viewpoints over the statistical recombination mishmash. If it matters, we do prefer the human touch.\n\nThat being said, We will all fall short or disagree once in a while with one or more of these preferences and expected behaviors. And - within reason - there is nothing wrong with that. Life's complicated.\n\nTo get back to the question whether LLMs are a positive for society, the answer depends entirely on what we are using LLMs for.

				"title": "#100DaysToOffload Reflexions After Two Weeks Of Having Accepted My Ineffectiveness",
				"content_html": "<p>(I started #100DaysToOffload on the first of June and have written - not including this one - 12 Posts. I guess that&rsquo;s enough to make it? About a third of my days are spent pressing publish on a blog post. So far so good. Before I finished this paragraph, I was thinking that I was too slow &hellip;)</p>\n<p>I had reasons to maybe reflect more inwardly for a moment, which is why I didn&rsquo;t write for a couple of weeks or so. Things at work didn&rsquo;t go so well, which was mostly because of me being told I was slow (and having been shown incontrovertible evidence proving this) and having to learn and having to un-learn and to accept a new truth about myself: That I am being slow and me being good (as good as I am which is good but not <em>evenly</em> good and certainly not fast) at my work was and is mostly a result of being slow and willing to make up for it by working longer. Which is not a mode of working that is economical and that pays the bills.</p>\n<p>In a big company this might not matter as much. You&rsquo;re embedded within a team, within a project and within a department, which will protect you somewhat from being directly exposed to your impact on the company&rsquo;s bottom line. But the smaller the company the more directly the way in which you&rsquo;re contributing to the value that is being created by that company is noticeable. You&rsquo;ll feel it way quicker and more directed towards yourself if things are out of order if it happens to be cause by the way you work. In my case being called ineffective repeatedly over my first year at the new job was both shocking and accompanied by disbelief and dread. But I only needed to look at my estimates, the time it actually took to implement a feature and how many of the hours the company could actually charge the customer and compare that with my coworkers. The feedback was real and objective. It still took me almost a year to accept it.</p>\n<p>As you can imagine: Realizing that you&rsquo;re slow and ineffective had and still has all sorts of cascading side effects. I reexamine what I believe to know about myself and what I think is true about the nature of work and live in general. Contemplative sense-making has become more of an important part of a good live for me than the only way of being. I notice others that are slower and see companions. Like my barber, for example. And I appreciate that she takes her time. Whereas before I was sure that any criticism of a slow life is just an uninformed un-thought-through opinion, I now come to recognize - intellectually, if not yet experientially/emotionally - that you can maybe also want to be effective instead (or in addition). I still bristle at the insinuation that living an exploratory, tranquil live has anything to do with wasted effort, but I will have to somehow figure out a way to combine economical pressures with the qualities that make a live, no, <em>my live</em>, worth living: Reflexion, focussed attention, taking my time, craftspersonship, exploration, deep understanding, empathy, diversity. I kind of still don&rsquo;t know what this all means.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m willing to find out, though. And what I do understand: That not being effective is what holds me back in my career, maybe in live. So I will have to go through this crucible. I am not making money in a contemplative career - I am no writer, academic, critic or whatever. So I can&rsquo;t just turn around and proclaim that a fiber of the reality I live in is somehow &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; as if there is a choice to be made by me. I may bring myself to call it a negative or bad aspect of a modern, digital, data-driven and market-oriented society, but this still means I&rsquo;ll have to live with it and master it to the best of my abilities.</p>\n",

Before I finished this paragraph, I was thinking that I was too slow ...)\n\nI had reasons to maybe reflect more inwardly for a moment, which is why I didn't write for a couple of weeks or so. Things at work didn't go so well, which was mostly because of me being told I was slow (and having been shown incontrovertible evidence proving this) and having to learn and having to un-learn and to accept a new truth about myself: That I am being slow and me being good (as good as I am which is good but not _evenly_ good and certainly not fast) at my work was and is mostly a result of being slow and willing to make up for it by working longer. Which is not a mode of working that is economical and that pays the bills.\n\nIn a big company this might not matter as much. You're embedded within a team, within a project and within a department, which will protect you somewhat from being directly exposed to your impact on the company's bottom line. But the smaller the company the more directly the way in which you're contributing to the value that is being created by that company is noticeable. You'll feel it way quicker and more directed towards yourself if things are out of order if it happens to be cause by the way you work. In my case being called ineffective repeatedly over my first year at the new job was both shocking and accompanied by disbelief and dread. But I only needed to look at my estimates, the time it actually took to implement a feature and how many of the hours the company could actually charge the customer and compare that with my coworkers. The feedback was real and objective. It still took me almost a year to accept it.\n\nAs you can imagine: Realizing that you're slow and ineffective had and still has all sorts of cascading side effects. I reexamine what I believe to know about myself and what I think is true about the nature of work and live in general. Contemplative sense-making has become more of an important part of a good live for me than the only way of being. I notice others that are slower and see companions. Like my barber, for example. And I appreciate that she takes her time. Whereas before I was sure that any criticism of a slow life is just an uninformed un-thought-through opinion, I now come to recognize - intellectually, if not yet experientially/emotionally - that you can maybe also want to be effective instead (or in addition). I still bristle at the insinuation that living an exploratory, tranquil live has anything to do with wasted effort, but I will have to somehow figure out a way to combine economical pressures with the qualities that make a live, no, _my live_, worth living: Reflexion, focussed attention, taking my time, craftspersonship, exploration, deep understanding, empathy, diversity. I kind of still don't know what this all means.\n\nI'm willing to find out, though. And what I do understand: That not being effective is what holds me back in my career, maybe in live. So I will have to go through this crucible. I am not making money in a contemplative career - I am no writer, academic, critic or whatever. So I can't just turn around and proclaim that a fiber of the reality I live in is somehow \"wrong\" as if there is a choice to be made by me. I may bring myself to call it a negative or bad aspect of a modern, digital, data-driven and market-oriented society, but this still means I'll have to live with it and master it to the best of my abilities.\n",

				"title": "#100DaysToOffload Categorizing Code Changes",
				"content_html": "<p>In an effort to become more efficient, I wondered how I have tackled issues at work so far:</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a little categorization of how I approach different kinds of code changes.</p>\n<p>(Disclosure: I don&rsquo;t do this literally, but intuitively &hellip;)</p>\n<p>First, I ask myself if the change is trivial or not. Is it just something really small and contained, like changing a constant or what is returned from a method? Or a small visual change? This is so easy that I generally only do that change and nothing else. Maybe I add a type hint or update some kind of documentation if it exists. But that&rsquo;s it. Hard to get more efficient here.</p>\n<p>If the change is more complex, I subdivide this category immediately into two subcategories: is it something entirely new or is it a substantial change of existing code.</p>\n<p>What makes these two cases different is the kind of analysis (and implementation; see below) I&rsquo;m doing. If it&rsquo;s new stuff, I try to imagine what a good, modern, sustainably maintainable version of the app or website I&rsquo;m working on might be in general. What would be a good, extendable starting point? Very often the tech stack is set, but the question becomes how to use what is given in the intended/best‚Ñ¢ way.</p>\n<p>For example I recently was asked to implement a CRUD-App as part of the admin interface of a website. After some probing on what the appropriate tech stack might look like - since I hadn&rsquo;t yet done a greenfield implementation in this project - I knew what tech stack template to fill out. I decided what layers I needed, what build system to use for the frontend, how to bundle the backend code, how to test the code and how to run those tests in a pipeline on push. Some of these things were realized easily, others took longer, for some of them I had ideas for what modern best practices looked like, for others I had to research them. Because the system this crud app was a part of monolithic &ldquo;portlet&rdquo; system that subdivides the contents of a page into reusable widgets, we had to take this into account, even though we didn&rsquo;t need that much complexity. In the end, I built a relatively modern portlet-compatible crud app. While implementing the core features I learned more about the entities we were dealing with and how they connected to the rest of the website, which meant doing revisions of the main model a bunch of times and it turned out that the JavaScript module had to be relatively complex because we wanted some interactivity that I knew about but hadn&rsquo;t thought about hard enough beforehand. So yeah. Lots of extra work upfront to make working with this crud app nicer later and a good amount of revisions during the main implementation phase of the mvp to fulfill the architectural and quality criteria I had set for myself.</p>\n<p>If it&rsquo;s a complex code change the cuts across lots of different already existing modules or classes, the question is more how we can make these classes friendlier to accept change in the future in general and how my changes could be implemented in such a way that they themselves can be changed easily. So not only the integration code but also the feature code should be extendable, readable and hopefully easier to reason about after I touched it.</p>\n<p>Another task I had was to repair and update a multi-tenant system&rsquo;s copy tenant functionality.

				"content_text": "In an effort to become more efficient, I wondered how I have tackled issues at work so far:\n\nHere's a little categorization of how I approach different kinds of code changes.\n\n(Disclosure: I don't do this literally, but intuitively ...)\n\nFirst, I ask myself if the change is trivial or not. Is it just something really small and contained, like changing a constant or what is returned from a method? Or a small visual change? This is so easy that I generally only do that change and nothing else. Maybe I add a type hint or update some kind of documentation if it exists. But that's it. Hard to get more efficient here.\n\nIf the change is more complex, I subdivide this category immediately into two subcategories: is it something entirely new or is it a substantial change of existing code.\n\nWhat makes these two cases different is the kind of analysis (and implementation; see below) I'm doing. If it's new stuff, I try to imagine what a good, modern, sustainably maintainable version of the app or website I'm working on might be in general. What would be a good, extendable starting point? Very often the tech stack is set, but the question becomes how to use what is given in the intended/best‚Ñ¢ way.\n\nFor example I recently was asked to implement a CRUD-App as part of the admin interface of a website. After some probing on what the appropriate tech stack might look like - since I hadn't yet done a greenfield implementation in this project - I knew what tech stack template to fill out. I decided what layers I needed, what build system to use for the frontend, how to bundle the backend code, how to test the code and how to run those tests in a pipeline on push. Some of these things were realized easily, others took longer, for some of them I had ideas for what modern best practices looked like, for others I had to research them. Because the system this crud app was a part of monolithic \"portlet\" system that subdivides the contents of a page into reusable widgets, we had to take this into account, even though we didn't need that much complexity. In the end, I built a relatively modern portlet-compatible crud app. While implementing the core features I learned more about the entities we were dealing with and how they connected to the rest of the website, which meant doing revisions of the main model a bunch of times and it turned out that the JavaScript module had to be relatively complex because we wanted some interactivity that I knew about but hadn't thought about hard enough beforehand. So yeah. Lots of extra work upfront to make working with this crud app nicer later and a good amount of revisions during the main implementation phase of the mvp to fulfill the architectural and quality criteria I had set for myself.\n\nIf it's a complex code change the cuts across lots of different already existing modules or classes, the question is more how we can make these classes friendlier to accept change in the future in general and how my changes could be implemented in such a way that they themselves can be changed easily. So not only the integration code but also the feature code should be extendable, readable and hopefully easier to reason about after I touched it.\n\nAnother task I had was to repair and update a multi-tenant system's copy tenant functionality. This was a complex task that cut through a big chunk of code. It was extra complex because the legacy system had some quirks you needed to know about and was very hard to test, because some of the classes were autogenerated and copying a tenant took minutes to complete. After a long and sometimes arduous process of trying to understand how the system worked and how its data was organized, I reimplemented the copy tenant functionality that had previously been based on copying its mostly hierarchical data on assumptions that didn't hold true anymore, so that it would not presume things that would lead to broken tenants, fixed a handful of bugs and unexpected behaviors on the way, but also made sure that the button \"copy tenant\" basically did what it did before, only now finally correctly. I'm not going to lie: I had tons of help to accomplish this herculean task and it's not humility that makes me give credit for most of the actual implementation in the end to one of my lead programmers. Big chunks of time were spent understanding the legacy code, figuring out where it went wrong and figuring out where and how to put the corrected code in a mostly non invasive way.\n\nSo both kinds of complex change consisted of chunks of implementation and blocks of analysis. Both types had some work that was extra in some way.

				"content_html": "<p>I had a hard day at work. It was hard, because I ended a streak of about three days, in which I was unable to work productively and today was the day in which I finally had to &ldquo;show my work&rdquo;. And then nobody saw my work. But now it&rsquo;s lying there, out in the open, awaiting feedback. And I have to go into the weekend with a feeling of dread.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m a programmer by trade and a slow, but hard-working, explorative kind of person in general. I love to find out how things work, how they maybe could work better and how to make a system such that it can communicate well with the people maintaining it. Which means that I&rsquo;d rather spend weeks reworking a legacy system, improving its workings and reorganizing and tidying up its architecture than implementing new features. So I like to do the work that is most often appreciated by other programmers - on a good day (most often people will not really notice &hellip; until they do). Keeping a system in good working order. Like a well oiled machine. Notice that end users or features are not necessarily part of that. It&rsquo;s not like features are uninteresting or unimportant to me, but the <em>how</em> and the <em>why</em> matter to me a whole lot more. Especially the how.</p>\n<p>However. Because I get payed for features or bug fixes on features and not for refactoring, removing technical debt or thinking about software architecture, I am not the best programmer for the kinds of tasks my company offers, sometimes, I&rsquo;m afraid. It sucks to admit, but I am pretty slow, when just measured on delivered features compared to many others. The main reason is that I am unable, maybe also unwilling, to &ldquo;just deliver&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>I assume that being able to &ldquo;just deliver&rdquo; - meaning without refactorings (e.g. to make especially gnarly code comprehensible for me and future programmers) or enhancements of the project&rsquo;s setup (e.g. to configure an autoload feature as I needed to do today) - is the result of either not seeing the problems (e.g. maybe not being as experienced, yet) or being experienced enough to not care about the problems anymore (e.g. maybe by having had to navigate some portion of legacy code so often, that they just know where to look without the need to make the code more comprehensible).</p>\n<p>But I see it everywhere at my work: The people who are good enough to be hired permanently (which I was, too, somehow ‚Ä¶) all seem to possess something I don&rsquo;t.

				"content_text": "I had a hard day at work. It was hard, because I ended a streak of about three days, in which I was unable to work productively and today was the day in which I finally had to \"show my work\". And then nobody saw my work. But now it's lying there, out in the open, awaiting feedback. And I have to go into the weekend with a feeling of dread.\n\nI'm a programmer by trade and a slow, but hard-working, explorative kind of person in general. I love to find out how things work, how they maybe could work better and how to make a system such that it can communicate well with the people maintaining it. Which means that I'd rather spend weeks reworking a legacy system, improving its workings and reorganizing and tidying up its architecture than implementing new features. So I like to do the work that is most often appreciated by other programmers - on a good day (most often people will not really notice ... until they do). Keeping a system in good working order. Like a well oiled machine. Notice that end users or features are not necessarily part of that. It's not like features are uninteresting or unimportant to me, but the _how_ and the _why_ matter to me a whole lot more. Especially the how.\n\nHowever. Because I get payed for features or bug fixes on features and not for refactoring, removing technical debt or thinking about software architecture, I am not the best programmer for the kinds of tasks my company offers, sometimes, I'm afraid. It sucks to admit, but I am pretty slow, when just measured on delivered features compared to many others. The main reason is that I am unable, maybe also unwilling, to \"just deliver\".\n\nI assume that being able to \"just deliver\" - meaning without refactorings (e.g. to make especially gnarly code comprehensible for me and future programmers) or enhancements of the project's setup (e.g. to configure an autoload feature as I needed to do today) - is the result of either not seeing the problems (e.g. maybe not being as experienced, yet) or being experienced enough to not care about the problems anymore (e.g. maybe by having had to navigate some portion of legacy code so often, that they just know where to look without the need to make the code more comprehensible).\n\nBut I see it everywhere at my work: The people who are good enough to be hired permanently (which I was, too, somehow ‚Ä¶) all seem to possess something I don't. I hesitate to call it more experience or talent. Which is not to say that I am perfect. I do readily admit that I totally have blind spots. And even where I feel confident, I know that I could still learn a lot more. And I also admit that my values are sometimes at odds with what is the bread and butter of my job: just deliver features. On time. Without too much back and forth, in acceptable quality (but nothing more, since nobody is able or willing to pay for it).\n\nSo what is it then that makes my colleagues better at this? I think it is a willingness to not care as much. That's the \"just\" part of the \"just deliver\" motto. I don't mean that derogatory, even though it sounds like it at first. If you are able to not care about technical purity you may be able to deliver faster.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I said this - slightly edited here for brevity since not everything is relevant - in a reply to Jason Becker under one of his posts and wanted to shortly explain what I mean by that.</p>\n<p>It seems relatively easy to fall victim to attribute to intent what is simply an expression of a system. Since we can&rsquo;t observe society as a whole we may think that there are intentions involved in the sense that you make a conscious choice to behave in one way or another - in this case it was about having the feeling of not being able to give a complex take because an audience nowadays demands a simple take - and any members of the audience as well as the one talking to said audience has lots of freedom in how to behave here. Rational discourse then can decide the best course of action. Critiques like this suggest that it could be different if we would just choose to behave differently (and here some good reasons for doing it or alternatively some bad reasons to no do the old thing anymore).</p>\n<p>Now, the text I replied to here is called <a href=\"https://json.blog/2024/05/21/takes-spread-like.html\">Takes spread like wildfire</a>. What I love most about this blog post - and <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/05/24/weblogpomo-thoughts-on.html\">I commented on it before</a> actually - is the title, because it doesn&rsquo;t assume that anybody is doing anything on purpose. It just happens. This I totally agree with.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m generally very interested in the make-do. As in: &ldquo;I was made to do this&rdquo;. As I don&rsquo;t assume intentions I also don&rsquo;t assume clear-cut flows of cause and effect. I believe in entanglement. Meaning: There are a million little things we are connected to - human as well as non-human actors - and all of these act as weights on our doing and being. In a sense we are these weights. Part of these weights are internal. I do think we have to assume consciousness. But internal or external weights: we are a <em>result</em>. And if we are results then so are our actions. Except that our actions are not the result of us because we are just a part of the chain (or better: net) through which something like a society expresses and reproduces itself.</p>\n<p>As an individual that has the capability to learn and observe, we may never untangle any of the entanglements that surround us in real time. But: We may learn to readjust our internal weights, so to speak. And this in turn is observable by people who care. This will never be everyone. And even those who care may not be able to see. But there is a potential here, which lies in a convincing performance and not rational argument.</p>\n<p>Which is why I would say that performing a certain way of being is probably more likely - and let&rsquo;s be clear here: it is still far from a clear a-&gt;b thing and not highly probable in the slightest - to inspire others to act with this new way of being in mind. What they do with it individually and as a collective is absolutely not in your hands, though.</p>\n<p>So if it is about subtle takes: Make them! Realize a person - make a person a reality - that makes interesting, subtle takes. They may spread. You may get critiqued. People may want simpler answers. If it is about politics they may sort you more to the right and less progressive than you&rsquo;d think. If you can&rsquo;t realize a person like that - because it might bring harm to people you care about - that is society protecting itself. Maybe make only some takes subtle that don&rsquo;t endanger what is vulnerable if a person like this would exist?</p>\n",

My reflex is to say: Not much. Intentions are a lag measure. That doesn't mean we shouldn't support what we think is important to create the world we want to live in - even if it's only for our own sakes - and support the people and actions the seem to us necessary to make these things more likely, but I do think this stuff is merely necessary but not sufficient to change the course of the world at large. So we'll have to live within the world in which we live, warts and all.</p>\n\n<p>This implies to me that what follows from your observations is no ownership of cause and effect but recognition of our collective limitations. I don't think that we make actual choices in that way as you hope.</p>\n<footer>matti <cite><a href=\"https://micro.blog/matti/38144245\" class=\"u-in-reply-to\">https://micro.blog/matti/38144245</a></cite></footer></blockquote><script src=\"https://cdn.micro.blog/quoteback.js\"></script>\n\nI said this - slightly edited here for brevity since not everything is relevant - in a reply to Jason Becker under one of his posts and wanted to shortly explain what I mean by that. \n\nIt seems relatively easy to fall victim to attribute to intent what is simply an expression of a system. Since we can't observe society as a whole we may think that there are intentions involved in the sense that you make a conscious choice to behave in one way or another - in this case it was about having the feeling of not being able to give a complex take because an audience nowadays demands a simple take - and any members of the audience as well as the one talking to said audience has lots of freedom in how to behave here. Rational discourse then can decide the best course of action. Critiques like this suggest that it could be different if we would just choose to behave differently (and here some good reasons for doing it or alternatively some bad reasons to no do the old thing anymore).\n\nNow, the text I replied to here is called [Takes spread like wildfire](https://json.blog/2024/05/21/takes-spread-like.html). What I love most about this blog post - and [I commented on it before](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/05/24/weblogpomo-thoughts-on.html) actually - is the title, because it doesn't assume that anybody is doing anything on purpose. It just happens. This I totally agree with.\n\nI'm generally very interested in the make-do. As in: \"I was made to do this\". As I don't assume intentions I also don't assume clear-cut flows of cause and effect. I believe in entanglement. Meaning: There are a million little things we are connected to - human as well as non-human actors - and all of these act as weights on our doing and being. In a sense we are these weights. Part of these weights are internal. I do think we have to assume consciousness. But internal or external weights: we are a _result_. And if we are results then so are our actions. Except that our actions are not the result of us because we are just a part of the chain (or better: net) through which something like a society expresses and reproduces itself.\n\nAs an individual that has the capability to learn and observe, we may never untangle any of the entanglements that surround us in real time. But: We may learn to readjust our internal weights, so to speak. And this in turn is observable by people who care. This will never be everyone. And even those who care may not be able to see. But there is a potential here, which lies in a convincing performance and not rational argument.\n\nWhich is why I would say that performing a certain way of being is probably more likely - and let's be clear here: it is still far from a clear a->b thing and not highly probable in the slightest - to inspire others to act with this new way of being in mind. What they do with it individually and as a collective is absolutely not in your hands, though.\n\nSo if it is about subtle takes: Make them! Realize a person - make a person a reality - that makes interesting, subtle takes. They may spread. You may get critiqued. People may want simpler answers. If it is about politics they may sort you more to the right and less progressive than you'd think. If you can't realize a person like that - because it might bring harm to people you care about - that is society protecting itself. Maybe make only some takes subtle that don't endanger what is vulnerable if a person like this would exist?\n",

And for you personally, efficiency gains may do exactly that. But collectively, efficiency seems to have the opposite effect As technology gets more efficient, we tend to consume more resources. This backfire effect is known as the ‚ÄòJevons paradox‚Äô, and it occurs for a simple reason. At a social level, efficiency is not a tool for conservation; it‚Äôs a catalyst for technological sprawl.1</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Here‚Äôs how it works. As technology gets more efficient, it cheapens the service that it provides. And when services get cheaper, we tend to use more of them. Hence, efficiency ends up catalyzing greater consumption.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Take the evolution of computers as an example. The first computers were room-sized machines that gulped power while doing snail-paced calculations. In contrast, modern computers deliver about a trillion times more computation for the same energy input. Now, in principle, we could have taken this trillion-fold efficiency improvement and reduced our computational energy budget by the same amount. But we didn‚Äôt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It gets harder and harder to not talk about the planetary trajectory as set in stone.

Change is impossible to envision. Especially if imagined as collective change on a planetary scale. Things will have to become <em>much</em> worse before we can meaningfully engage with what happens. Maybe this is not <em>you</em>, but it is us. You can warn and write all the manifestos you want, have a negative footprint or whatever: Just as with AI we&rsquo;ll have to come to terms with the fact that climate change is just us. We&rsquo;re the planet. And as the planet is the result and the cause of what&rsquo;s going on, the individual will have to recognize and come to terms with not being able to do a lot.</p>\n<p>There is hope in disruption. But strategically &ldquo;weaponized&rdquo; disruption (like calculated, non-violent <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/05/18/weblogpomo-a-rational.html\">protest</a>) can only do so much and it seems that big economic players like Big Tech‚Ñ¢ to name an example are not even playing within the margins of democracy any more. Take this quote from <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/05/big-tech-eu-drop-dead\">a recent Cory Doctrow article</a> on the EU&rsquo;s attempt to regulate tech giants via the DMA:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Apple appears to be playing a high-stakes game of chicken with EU regulators, effectively saying, ‚ÄúYes, you have 500 million citizens, but we have three trillion dollars, so why should we listen to you?‚Äù [‚Ä¶] Just like Apple, Meta is behaving as though the DMA permits it to carry on its worst behavior, with minor cosmetic tweaks around the margins. Just like Apple, Meta is daring the EU to enforce its democratically enacted laws, implicitly promising to pit its billions against Europe‚Äôs institutions to preserve its right to spy on us. [‚Ä¶] Tech has found new ways to compromise our privacy rights, our labor rights, and our consumer rights - at scale. [‚Ä¶] After decades of regulatory indifference to tech monopolization, competition authorities all over the world are taking on Big Tech. The DMA is by far the most muscular and ambitious salvo we‚Äôve seen. [‚Ä¶] Seen in that light, it‚Äôs no surprise that Big Tech is refusing to comply with the rules. If the EU successfully forces tech to play fair, it will serve as a starting gun for a global race to the top, in which tech‚Äôs ill-gotten gains - of data, power and money - will be returned to the users and workers from whom that treasure came.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even if the DMA will be enforced completely and the EU won&rsquo;t let big companies weasel out of actually complying, I have very little hope that this game of resisting compliance and enacting policies is not continuing for the foreseeable future. Non compliance is surely not a phenomenon exclusive to Big Tech. Far from it. Which means that even if we get the right people to put policies into place to reign in companies this cat and mouse game is just going to make sure that climate change is even more of a sure thing.</p>\n<p>And what about all of the non-democratic societies? And what about all those non-environmental governments who do nothing? Can you solve a planetary problem while parts of the world are at war with each other? Or at least are ideologically opposed? What about China?</p>\n<p>I read <a href=\"https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-big-tariffs-are-here\">an article by Noah Smith</a> about the wider implications of the tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles the US have enacted. A couple of things form this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Joe Biden is about to slap 100% tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles. A 100% tariff is an absolutely huge tariff. It means that Chinese EV makers would have to sell their EVs in the U.S. at half the price of EVs manufactured elsewhere in order to be competitive. That just isn‚Äôt going to happen. A 100% tariff will probably be enough to keep essentially all made-in-China EVs out of the U.S.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And further, himself quoting David Fickling:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A lot of people are worried that tariffs like these will slow down the transition to a low-carbon future powered by solar power and batteries. For example, David Fickling writes:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>China‚Äôs widening lead in clean technology, coupled with its vast trade surplus‚Ä¶are combining with faltering efforts on decarbonization in developed countries to produce a toxic mix‚Ä¶If green technology such as electric vehicles‚Ä¶gets badged as foreign and threatening and finds itself excluded via‚Ä¶tariff policies, then drastically falling costs aren‚Äôt going to be enough to get it into the hands of consumers‚Ä¶An acceleration in trade wars will only slow our path to zero [carbon].</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He‚Äôs right to worry. Transportation is responsible for almost 30% of U.S. carbon emissions, or about 4% of the global total. If the U.S. failed to switch to EVs, it could hamper decarbonization efforts by a small but noticeable amount.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And a last one from this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The most important thing about these tariffs is probably the message they send. Protectionism is now the consensus economic policy of both major political parties in the United States. Biden has extended the Trump tariffs on China and levied the new EV tariffs; Trump is trying to one-up Biden by promising to raise the 100% tariffs to 200%, extend them to Mexico, and slap an additional 60% tariff on all Chinese-made goods. There is currently no major party or presidential candidate that you can vote for in America that is even remotely interested in free trade.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What I take from this is that the biggest economies are at a trade war with each other and it&rsquo;s about to get very ideological on planet earth again(?) - but not in an environmentally friendly ideological way we might hope for. Meaning that systematic improvements of the climate situation are completely unlikely. Because a climate neutral Europe won&rsquo;t be enough and itself utterly unlikely. I do not have hope for the rest of the planet.</p>\n<p>All this is to say that: We will have to live with it. We will have to accept climate change. We won&rsquo;t be able to stop the catastrophe. All the displaced people. All the pain and suffering. All the biodiversity loss.</p>\n<p>What is interesting though, is that fossil fuels won&rsquo;t last forever and the world&rsquo;s overindulgence in a surplus of energy that is not bound to the solar energy system (as opposed to the fossil energy system that spurred much of industrialization) is inevitable. We will not live to see this, but we also won&rsquo;t stop the shit show until then. The planet will go through this. I don&rsquo;t see how it wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>\n",

It means that Chinese EV makers would have to sell their EVs in the U.S. at half the price of EVs manufactured elsewhere in order to be competitive. That just isn‚Äôt going to happen. A 100% tariff will probably be enough to keep essentially all made-in-China EVs out of the U.S.\n\nAnd further, himself quoting David Fickling:\n\n>A lot of people are worried that tariffs like these will slow down the transition to a low-carbon future powered by solar power and batteries. For example, David Fickling writes:\n\n>>China‚Äôs widening lead in clean technology, coupled with its vast trade surplus‚Ä¶are combining with faltering efforts on decarbonization in developed countries to produce a toxic mix‚Ä¶If green technology such as electric vehicles‚Ä¶gets badged as foreign and threatening and finds itself excluded via‚Ä¶tariff policies, then drastically falling costs aren‚Äôt going to be enough to get it into the hands of consumers‚Ä¶An acceleration in trade wars will only slow our path to zero [carbon].\n\n>He‚Äôs right to worry. Transportation is responsible for almost 30% of U.S. carbon emissions, or about 4% of the global total. If the U.S. failed to switch to EVs, it could hamper decarbonization efforts by a small but noticeable amount.\n\nAnd a last one from this:\n\n>The most important thing about these tariffs is probably the message they send. Protectionism is now the consensus economic policy of both major political parties in the United States. Biden has extended the Trump tariffs on China and levied the new EV tariffs; Trump is trying to one-up Biden by promising to raise the 100% tariffs to 200%, extend them to Mexico, and slap an additional 60% tariff on all Chinese-made goods. There is currently no major party or presidential candidate that you can vote for in America that is even remotely interested in free trade.\n\nWhat I take from this is that the biggest economies are at a trade war with each other and it's about to get very ideological on planet earth again(?) - but not in an environmentally friendly ideological way we might hope for. Meaning that systematic improvements of the climate situation are completely unlikely. Because a climate neutral Europe won't be enough and itself utterly unlikely. I do not have hope for the rest of the planet.\n\nAll this is to say that: We will have to live with it. We will have to accept climate change. We won't be able to stop the catastrophe. All the displaced people. All the pain and suffering. All the biodiversity loss.\n\nWhat is interesting though, is that fossil fuels won't last forever and the world's overindulgence in a surplus of energy that is not bound to the solar energy system (as opposed to the fossil energy system that spurred much of industrialization) is inevitable. We will not live to see this, but we also won't stop the shit show until then. The planet will go through this. I don't see how it wouldn't.\n",

Note that these things seem similar to what I wrote above, but they are different. One way in which these are different is that a platform is not owned by its users. Another way they are different is that people in charge are not elected by its users. So the dynamic of pissing of fellow citizens, them complaining to politicians to end the disruption and the politicians having to decide to either answer with ethically questionable violence or by granting the wish to the protesters is not working in the same way.

				"title": "#WeblogPoMo2024 - Vulnerable Thoughts Around LLMS and generative AI",
				"content_html": "<p>It makes me extremely uncomfortable to think in terms of ethics when it comes to generative AI. I would like to say that <a href=\"https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2024/you-should-not-be-using-llms/\">I am agreeing with Baldur Bjarnason on the matter</a> and that there is actually nothing to discuss, but only to state that AI is unethical, unsustainable, un-researched and actively harmful to the planet and its inhabitants. It&rsquo;s also a <a href=\"https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2024/the-unsustainability-of-the-ai-bubble/\">bubble</a> and can&rsquo;t deliver on its promise:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Found via a Reddit post about a WSJ article quoting a Sequioa presentation</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In a presentation earlier this month, the venture-capital firm Sequoia estimated that the AI industry spent $50 billion on the Nvidia chips used to train advanced AI models last year, but brought in only $3 billion in revenue.\nThis 17x number is just for chips ‚Äì Nvidia chips alone, I think ‚Äì so the actual cost-to-revenue multiplier is much higher in reality.\nSo the hardware it‚Äôs installed in and the actual CPUs are extra. Research is extra. The army of freelancers used for RLHF training are extra. Electricity cost is extra.\nAnd chips depreciate in value pretty rapidly. Especially since every chip vendor on the planet has more specialised ML chips in the pipeline that are more effective at the task. This investment will be worthless pretty quickly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But then ‚Ä¶ I am using it at work - where my employers pay for a pro version for us to use - and even in my free time I use it as my access to a more advanced version makes it more interesting to use and I&rsquo;m - as I am so often - caught up in a kind of fatalist argument, it seems: I do not see LLMs going away. Do I feel better for not using them? Only theoretically. I feel like I am learning things while I use them because there are actually wast swaths of what I am theoretically supposed to to be able to do at work that I can&rsquo;t do without a nudge here and there. Same is true in recreational programming.</p>\n<p>In theory I feel that keeping myself morally untouchable and staying &ldquo;pure&rdquo; is interesting, but just as I tried to express <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/05/13/weblogpomo-thoughts-on.html\">when I was talking about manifestos</a> and their harsh delineation between good and bad according to a standard they define without outlining the practical steps to make this a reality, I find myself reaching for the same here: Purity is theoretically interesting, but practically life happens elsewhere and so it is more a question of degree, if anything.</p>\n<p>I can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t deny the fact that I find these AI tools helpful and interesting, sometimes. I won&rsquo;t not agree either that they are also not unproblematic. However, I will say that excluding these things from your life - by individual consumer choice - doesn&rsquo;t do anything to make them do less harm, make them more sustainable or actually changing the practicalities of life. We have become very good at defining things in such an &ldquo;either/or&rdquo; way that it has become useless to apply these standards to any real life situation, where you may be forced, coerced or seduced into - for example - using these things. What now? Time to stop living? Time to apologize for the rest of your life? I think that we may have to relearn how to examine the world.

				"content_text": "It makes me extremely uncomfortable to think in terms of ethics when it comes to generative AI. I would like to say that [I am agreeing with Baldur Bjarnason on the matter](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2024/you-should-not-be-using-llms/) and that there is actually nothing to discuss, but only to state that AI is unethical, unsustainable, un-researched and actively harmful to the planet and its inhabitants. It's also a [bubble](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2024/the-unsustainability-of-the-ai-bubble/) and can't deliver on its promise:\n\n>Found via a Reddit post about a WSJ article quoting a Sequioa presentation\n>>In a presentation earlier this month, the venture-capital firm Sequoia estimated that the AI industry spent $50 billion on the Nvidia chips used to train advanced AI models last year, but brought in only $3 billion in revenue.\n>This 17x number is just for chips ‚Äì Nvidia chips alone, I think ‚Äì so the actual cost-to-revenue multiplier is much higher in reality.\n>So the hardware it‚Äôs installed in and the actual CPUs are extra. Research is extra. The army of freelancers used for RLHF training are extra. Electricity cost is extra.\n>And chips depreciate in value pretty rapidly. Especially since every chip vendor on the planet has more specialised ML chips in the pipeline that are more effective at the task. This investment will be worthless pretty quickly.\n\nBut then ‚Ä¶ I am using it at work - where my employers pay for a pro version for us to use - and even in my free time I use it as my access to a more advanced version makes it more interesting to use and I'm - as I am so often - caught up in a kind of fatalist argument, it seems: I do not see LLMs going away. Do I feel better for not using them? Only theoretically. I feel like I am learning things while I use them because there are actually wast swaths of what I am theoretically supposed to to be able to do at work that I can't do without a nudge here and there. Same is true in recreational programming.\n\nIn theory I feel that keeping myself morally untouchable and staying \"pure\" is interesting, but just as I tried to express [when I was talking about manifestos](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2024/05/13/weblogpomo-thoughts-on.html) and their harsh delineation between good and bad according to a standard they define without outlining the practical steps to make this a reality, I find myself reaching for the same here: Purity is theoretically interesting, but practically life happens elsewhere and so it is more a question of degree, if anything.\n\nI can't and won't deny the fact that I find these AI tools helpful and interesting, sometimes. I won't not agree either that they are also not unproblematic. However, I will say that excluding these things from your life - by individual consumer choice - doesn't do anything to make them do less harm, make them more sustainable or actually changing the practicalities of life. We have become very good at defining things in such an \"either/or\" way that it has become useless to apply these standards to any real life situation, where you may be forced, coerced or seduced into - for example - using these things. What now? Time to stop living? Time to apologize for the rest of your life? I think that we may have to relearn how to examine the world. Not in terms of purity of our actions, but in terms of the realization of the world we inhabit.\n\nThis means manny big and small things. One small thing it means is to understand the relative limit any one's actions have on the whole. We are an expression of the whole, so not being able to change the whole is not THAT surprising, I'd say. This also means that better understanding the whole - for example by examining the insane amounts of money and resources that are put into training, developing and serving these models to customers (like in the quote above) and how insanely powerless we as individuals are to change this - helps understanding us and our place int this world.

				"content_html": "<p>The developer <a href=\"https://michellebarker.co.uk\">Michelle Barker</a> has published a very cool <a href=\"https://humanewebmanifesto.com\">Manifesto for A Humane Web</a> and I wanted to comment on it a little. I mostly wanted to point to some lines from Bruno Latour and his 2010 paper <a href=\"http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/120-NLH-finalpdf.pdf\">An Attempt at a &ldquo;Compositionist&rdquo; Manifesto</a> and comment on their implication for the Humane Web Manifesto, as far as I am interested in it here:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I know full well that, just like the time of avant-gardes or that of the Great Frontier, the time of manifestos has long passed. Actually, it is the time of time that has passed: this strange idea of a vast army moving forward, preceded by the most daring innovators and thinkers, followed by a mass of slower and heavier crowds, while the rearguard of the most archaic, the most primitive, the most reactionary people trails behind[‚Ä¶]. During this recently defunct time of time, manifestos were like so many war cries intended to speed up the movement, ridicule the Philistines, castigate the reactionaries. This huge warlike narrative was predicated on the idea that the flow of time had one‚Äîand only one‚Äîinevitable and irreversible direction. The war waged by the avant-gardes would be won, no matter how many defeats they suffered. What this series of manifestos pointed to was the inevitable march of progress. So much so that these manifestos could be used like so many signposts to decide who was more ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù and who was more ‚Äúreactionary.‚Äù</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And even though I love this text for it is a pretty good one, I will stop quoting after one more passage:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And yet a manifesto might not be so useless at this point, making explicit (that is, manifest) a subtle but radical transformation in the definition of what it means to progress, that is, to process forward and meet new prospects. Not as a war cry for an avant-garde to move even further and faster ahead, but rather as a warning, a call to attention, so as to stop going further in the same way as before toward the future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think that this understanding of what a manifesto could be in our modern world fits nicely to the way the web is going and how to proceed: Carefully and facing the future. With taking precautions and slowly. With an eye for a more &ldquo;ecologist&rdquo; web, that is with an eye for dependencies and conditions that make up diversity. I think this is a great framing for the humane web, because the categories used to frame this manifesto make clear what is needed for society of the web to make it in the wilderness that is the internet: &ldquo;accessible&rdquo;, &ldquo;inclusive&rdquo;, &ldquo;safe&rdquo;, &ldquo;secure&rdquo;, &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo;, &ldquo;reliable&rdquo;, &ldquo;resilient&rdquo;, &ldquo;transparent&rdquo;, &ldquo;independent&rdquo;, &ldquo;human-centred&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>I have some quibbles with some of the categories and especially coming from a Latourian actor-network perspective I find that using the term &ldquo;society&rdquo; (as in &ldquo;Like a functioning society, we take what we need, and we contribute what we can. We are citizens of the web‚Ä¶&quot;) would need to be qualified a little to make sure that we understand ourselves as makers being made by the web - which just means that tools have agency, too and that we have to lengthen our gaze a little past what we would traditionally call society. There is more involved.</p>\n<p>About those categories I will only note one more thing before trying to express what I would&rsquo;ve like to see more of. This point is that instead of &ldquo;independent&rdquo; I would have chosen the word interdependent. And instead of &ldquo;human-centred&rdquo; I would have chosen &ldquo;un-centered&rdquo; or &ldquo;distributed&rdquo;. But let&rsquo;s not get lost in the weeds.</p>\n<p>I know that this manifesto is very much of its time and reacts to platformism, late capitalism and the threat of &ldquo;Big AI&rdquo;. But I think it is important to realize that the society of the web needs to be assembled slowly, carefully, facing the complexities ahead by remaking - I would say - what here &amp; now means, by taking more time examining what lies before us.</p>\n<p>Sounds nebolous? But questions like the following arise from this stance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&ldquo;How exactly are we going to think of a web society?&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;How can an individual take meaningful steps?&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;What does it mean to not filter out by categories, those who are &ldquo;un-progressive&rdquo; or &ldquo;progressive with an asterisk&rdquo; but to describe a prospective future?&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;What series of steps can be taken as an assembly of actors (a team, a company, a neighborhood)?&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;What is implied by the difference of being un/humane? Are those who are humane able to sustain themselves in any way? How? Can we separate them from the un-humane ones? How? Is this a stable difference? Who differentiates?&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think the most understandable way I can put this - because I get annoyed by the way I have to express this as well, a little: If this manifesto and <a href=\"https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com\">others like it that it links to</a> point at something, is this something served by the playbook of exclusion/inclusion, sorting and filtering out? I imagine that whatever the humane web could be, it would express itself less in terms of framing out what it is not by underlining what it is, but by exploring what would make it possible to exist at all. What are the technologies, processes, organizational forms, ways of observing, tending to, maintaining, caring for and negotiating that could make a different web? This also implies what can stay - I assume the underwater cables, the http protocol can stay, CSS can stay, but what else? Do we <em>know</em> the web that is?</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m all for binding those &ldquo;How?&ldquo;s I would have liked to hear more about to a higher order thinking, but I am not so interested to be sorted into good or bad by adhering to either all of the categories or none, without being told what is needed to even make one of these categories a real thing on a planetary scale (is that the goal?) and what is done to make it worth it to try for that.</p>\n",

				"title": "A New Cross-Posting Workflow, Part 1: Requirements And Thoughts On Implementation",
				"content_html": "<p>(2024-05-20 - EDIT: I have decided, that I do not have enough time to devote to this project at this time, however I would really like it and it was good to think this through for when I am able to pick it up)</p>\n<p>You know what I don&rsquo;t like about my blog? The way it crossposts to other services. Micro.blog&rsquo;s understanding of cross-posting is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Micro.blog cross-posting copies your posts from this feed to external services automatically when you post to your blog.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which is not what I want. I would like it to work more in this way:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blog posts (with our without title) should be shared automatically on <a href=\"https://social.lol/@matti\">my Mastodon account</a> with a proper link, maybe an applicable hashtag. But it should be clear that I&rsquo;m sharing a blog post, which is not the same as writing a toot and that difference shouldn&rsquo;t therefore be invisible by just tooting the same content 1:1 as I posted on my blog</li>\n<li>An exception are the <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/categories/dailydogo/\">DailyDogos</a> and other posts like it (not that there are any at the moment‚Ä¶). These should be shared with the image attached. Maybe there is not even a need for the link, but it would be fine if it would be there</li>\n<li>When I&rsquo;m writing a toot, I&rsquo;d like my blog to archive a copy of that toot. The archived version should include images, links and whathaveyou.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So basically there are two workflows with a couple of conditionals I would like to implement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cross-Post all blog posts from my micro.blog to my mastodon (excluding posts that are archival copies of mastodon posts; denoted by being part of the category &ldquo;archivalCopyOfToot&rdquo;)\n<ul>\n<li>if the post has a title, use the title to create a link to the post and add any applicable hashtags by converting the assigned categories of said blog post to the toot</li>\n<li>if the post has no title\n<ul>\n<li>if the post has category of &ldquo;tootAsIs&rdquo;\n<ul>\n<li>add any images to the toot and post the contents of the blog post as is to mastodon (maybe add a link to the original on my blog)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>if the post has no category of &ldquo;tootAsIs&rdquo;\n<ul>\n<li>add a short (80 Chars and up to the next full word maybe?) excerpt and otherwise behave like a titled post</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I happen to have an <a href=\"https://echofeed.app\">Echofeed</a> account, which is part of the solution. I can point it at an RSS/JSON/Atom-Feed and it will post in a format I can specify to any of its supported services, which includes Mastodon and Micro.blog. It doesn&rsquo;t have any conditional logic, though, so I will have to provide it with feeds that only include posts that I want it to cross post.</p>\n<p>On the micro.blog side, this is maybe <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2023/06/18/the-hugo-template.html\">not trivial</a>, but at least is possible, since micro.blog uses <a href=\"https://gohugo.io\">Hugo</a> and you can - if you know how - customize it quite a bit. I&rsquo;ll need three feeds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A feed with only title posts, excluding any posts with the category &ldquo;archivalCopyOfToot&rdquo;</li>\n<li>A feed with only non-title posts, including only those of &ldquo;tootAsIs&rdquo; (and excluding any from the category &ldquo;archivalCopyOfToot&rdquo;)</li>\n<li>A feed with only non-title, excluding any of &ldquo;tootAsIs&rdquo; AND &ldquo;archivalCopyOfToot&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I would then set up three echos that cross post to mastodon in the right way.</p>\n<p>Mastodon on the other hand has <a href=\"https://social.lol/@matti.rss\">a feed of my posts</a> too, but it&rsquo;s much more limited and creating new custom feeds that filter posts based on e.g. a hashtag are not possible, I believe. This means that we can&rsquo;t filter for cross-posted blog posts and will necessarily import those items to our blog, too.

				"content_text": "(2024-05-20 - EDIT: I have decided, that I do not have enough time to devote to this project at this time, however I would really like it and it was good to think this through for when I am able to pick it up)\n\nYou know what I don't like about my blog? The way it crossposts to other services. Micro.blog's understanding of cross-posting is as follows:\n\n>Micro.blog cross-posting copies your posts from this feed to external services automatically when you post to your blog.\n\nWhich is not what I want. I would like it to work more in this way:\n\n- Blog posts (with our without title) should be shared automatically on [my Mastodon account](https://social.lol/@matti) with a proper link, maybe an applicable hashtag. But it should be clear that I'm sharing a blog post, which is not the same as writing a toot and that difference shouldn't therefore be invisible by just tooting the same content 1:1 as I posted on my blog\n- An exception are the [DailyDogos](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/categories/dailydogo/) and other posts like it (not that there are any at the moment‚Ä¶). These should be shared with the image attached. Maybe there is not even a need for the link, but it would be fine if it would be there\n- When I'm writing a toot, I'd like my blog to archive a copy of that toot. The archived version should include images, links and whathaveyou.\n\nSo basically there are two workflows with a couple of conditionals I would like to implement:\n\n- Cross-Post all blog posts from my micro.blog to my mastodon (excluding posts that are archival copies of mastodon posts; denoted by being part of the category \"archivalCopyOfToot\")\n\t- if the post has a title, use the title to create a link to the post and add any applicable hashtags by converting the assigned categories of said blog post to the toot\n\t- if the post has no title\n\t\t- if the post has category of \"tootAsIs\"\n\t\t\t- add any images to the toot and post the contents of the blog post as is to mastodon (maybe add a link to the original on my blog)\n\t\t- if the post has no category of \"tootAsIs\"\n\t\t\t- add a short (80 Chars and up to the next full word maybe?) excerpt and otherwise behave like a titled post\n\n\nI happen to have an [Echofeed](https://echofeed.app) account, which is part of the solution. I can point it at an RSS/JSON/Atom-Feed and it will post in a format I can specify to any of its supported services, which includes Mastodon and Micro.blog. It doesn't have any conditional logic, though, so I will have to provide it with feeds that only include posts that I want it to cross post.\n\nOn the micro.blog side, this is maybe [not trivial](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2023/06/18/the-hugo-template.html), but at least is possible, since micro.blog uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and you can - if you know how - customize it quite a bit. I'll need three feeds:\n\n- A feed with only title posts, excluding any posts with the category \"archivalCopyOfToot\"\n- A feed with only non-title posts, including only those of \"tootAsIs\" (and excluding any from the category \"archivalCopyOfToot\")\n- A feed with only non-title, excluding any of \"tootAsIs\" AND \"archivalCopyOfToot\"\n\nI would then set up three echos that cross post to mastodon in the right way.\n\nMastodon on the other hand has [a feed of my posts](https://social.lol/@matti.rss) too, but it's much more limited and creating new custom feeds that filter posts based on e.g. a hashtag are not possible, I believe. This means that we can't filter for cross-posted blog posts and will necessarily import those items to our blog, too. I would really like to avoid having to run my own script - locally or on a server - talking to their api or whatever, so I think I'll will have to live with the fact these duplicated posts will be crossposted back to my blog‚Ä¶\n\nWhat I can do is filter these posts out on the micro.blog side. Meaning posts that include a certain Hashtag like \"crossPostByEchoFeed\" (this could even be added inside Echofeed for the workflow that posts from Mastodon to MB and could be invisible to Mastodon followers) need to be excluded from the homepage, archive and any feeds of my blog (hashtags can be converted to categories using filters on micro.blog, so if I figure out how to filter by one or more categories in Hugo's template syntax, I should be fine implementing this).

However, a blog needs some form of a (design) theme and so I have generally opted for whatever the default is. The default is going to be maintained no matter what so it&rsquo;s a pretty safe bet. One thing that irks me a lot about micro.blog&rsquo;s default theme: How invisible the categories are! They are only visible on the archive page, not in the list of posts and not on the single post page either. I find this very impractical, because you can&rsquo;t browse other posts in the same category. Another thing is that the default theme doesn&rsquo;t do proper pagination. The homepage just includes 20 or so posts and that&rsquo;s it. You have to go to the archive page to see more posts, but there they are only visible in a truncated fashion. Long story short: I changed the theme! This one is called <a href=\"https://github.com/microdotblog/theme-minos\">Minos</a> and shows the categories above every post and has pagination.

				"content_html": "<p>Keine Erkl√§rungen. Ein Grund: Mir fehlt zunehmend die eigene Stimme. Und vielleicht zum ersten Mal seit langem fehlt mir das semi-√∂ffentliche Schreiben auf Deutsch. Oder das Schreiben √ºberhaupt, was auf Nichtdeutsch nicht kommen will. Daher.</p>\n<p>Gleichzeitig die zunehmende Gewissheit, dass ich wirklich in einer parasitischen Beziehung zu Deutschland lebe: Ich lebe von der M√∂glichkeit f√ºr eine deutsche Firma aus der Ferne zu arbeiten in einem anderen Land in dem ich ohne dieses Privileg bei Weitem nicht so gut dast√ºnde. Und bin ansonsten froh mit meinem Herkunftsland nicht viel am Hut zu haben.</p>\n<p>√úberhaupt: am-Hut-Haben ist meine St√§rke nicht. Man schl√§gt sich so durch, durch den Alltag. Es gibt viel zu tun, selbst in einer so kleinen Familie, wie es die meine ist: Partnerin und Hund und ich. Und gleichzeitig eine Wohnung, die nicht nur bezogen werden will, sondern ein Leben in sich verwalten will, gewisserma√üen gleichzeitig, rekursiv, einander √ºberlagernd, behindernd.</p>\n<p>Bezugspunkte sind es, die einen sehen lassen. Man lebte und dann bildete man sich eine Meinung und dann lebt man jetzt und zieht Bez√ºge, h√§lt Dinge f√ºr gleich, m√∂glich, wahrscheinlich, idiotisch, usw. Aber eben ob der Bezugspunkte. Und gleichzeitig komme ich nicht umhin festzustellen, dass das Leben jenseits eigener Kategorisierungen stattfindet und es wird zumindest behauptet, dass das auch funktioniert.

				"content_text": "Keine Erkl√§rungen. Ein Grund: Mir fehlt zunehmend die eigene Stimme. Und vielleicht zum ersten Mal seit langem fehlt mir das semi-√∂ffentliche Schreiben auf Deutsch. Oder das Schreiben √ºberhaupt, was auf Nichtdeutsch nicht kommen will. Daher.\n\nGleichzeitig die zunehmende Gewissheit, dass ich wirklich in einer parasitischen Beziehung zu Deutschland lebe: Ich lebe von der M√∂glichkeit f√ºr eine deutsche Firma aus der Ferne zu arbeiten in einem anderen Land in dem ich ohne dieses Privileg bei Weitem nicht so gut dast√ºnde. Und bin ansonsten froh mit meinem Herkunftsland nicht viel am Hut zu haben.\n\n√úberhaupt: am-Hut-Haben ist meine St√§rke nicht. Man schl√§gt sich so durch, durch den Alltag. Es gibt viel zu tun, selbst in einer so kleinen Familie, wie es die meine ist: Partnerin und Hund und ich. Und gleichzeitig eine Wohnung, die nicht nur bezogen werden will, sondern ein Leben in sich verwalten will, gewisserma√üen gleichzeitig, rekursiv, einander √ºberlagernd, behindernd.\n\nBezugspunkte sind es, die einen sehen lassen. Man lebte und dann bildete man sich eine Meinung und dann lebt man jetzt und zieht Bez√ºge, h√§lt Dinge f√ºr gleich, m√∂glich, wahrscheinlich, idiotisch, usw. Aber eben ob der Bezugspunkte. Und gleichzeitig komme ich nicht umhin festzustellen, dass das Leben jenseits eigener Kategorisierungen stattfindet und es wird zumindest behauptet, dass das auch funktioniert. Gemeint ist auch: Der Versuch hier etwas zum Konfliktpotenzial im Zwischenmenschlichen zu sagen. Worauf ich stolz bin: Dass es h√§ufig nicht lang dauert sich zu vertragen. Wir nagen an den Resten unserer Reserven, ja ja. Aber mit uns kann man das machen, denken wir vielleicht nicht mal, aber leben wir, machen es mit uns.\n\nSo der Umzug. Lediglich zu zweit.

				"content_text": "This year had so much potential and after two tough years in a row, I was really looking forward to a better one. If I focus on myself, the year was _okay_: I switched jobs for the better and worked on improving my overall approach to productivity. But as soon as I widen the circle even slightly, it becomes clear it was a bad year. There are no two ways about it: The year's end made it impossible to call it anything else.\n\n## An Awful End\n\nThe year took its most challenging turn when my partner lost her job in December. It was sudden and unexpected, but she handled it with incredible grace and professionalism. Despite our frustrations with the political climate affecting jobs, we need to learn to adapt and find new paths. We will be fine, but there's a lingering sadness over losing the relative safety we felt through all these challenging years since the pandemic.\n\n## Health Concerns\n\nAdditionally, towards the end of the year, my grandparents' health became more of a concern, reminding me to cherish every moment with them.

I'm thrilled about my new job, which I started in July. I have not only nice colleagues, but nice bosses, too. The work environment is open to my ideas and the tasks are challenging but well suited to my skills.\n\nOur summer was wonderful, including a memorable trip to Finland's Per√§meri National Park, visiting Kilpisj√§rvi once more and finally hiking through Malla's strict nature reserve.

One thing stood out as interesting to me in his post:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A cheap dinner with my parents is infinitely more meaningful than some networking dinner with strangers that costs me a fortune.

He then gives an example where spending relatively little money on an event doesn&rsquo;t mean that that event couldn&rsquo;t be more meaningful than another event that you spent more on. What Greenfeld has discovered is that you can&rsquo;t compare single events like this but must compare topics: The question is how do you spend your time - over your lifetime? Comparing two singular events doesn&rsquo;t make sense. But whether you spend your life mostly at networking dinners vs. mostly with your family does. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that when you have disregarded an important aspect of your life that choosing to spend more time on it - even if at first it&rsquo;s just a small amount - doesn&rsquo;t feel meaningful. But the meaningfulness doesn&rsquo;t come from it being a short event but rather from trying to rectify the neglect (or maybe exploring new frontiers).</p>\n<p>I do think it can be worth it to read opposing opinions like this because it strengthens my viewpoint, it points to flaws in my approach or simply just widens my horizon.

These people exist out there and they may not be easily convinced of the opposite. That&rsquo;s useful to keep in mind. Greenfeld and I are holding different values that&rsquo;s for sure and since values are personal one may be persuaded to think this is just a battle between differing subjective viewpoints. But the objective realities of life  - e.g. that your lifetime is limited and being more productive doesn&rsquo;t make life last longer or spending time fiddling with your productivity systems doesn&rsquo;t make you enjoy the important moments more - do not care if you would like to forget about these facts (and rather work hard to grow your business or whatever). You will have to come to terms with them - if you like to contemplate these things, or not.</p>\n<p>The post and its author is a useful counter example to my own life&rsquo;s plan: A (relatively) small but reflected life in the here and now is more rewarding, more livable, more rational, more emotionally honest and also more ethically sound, than any sweeping pronouncements of a &ldquo;big life&quot;‚Ñ¢ could ever be.</p>\n<p>My mental model predicts that sooner or later everyone will have to open their eyes to the small life they are actually living and embrace it - or failing that will live with a lot of avoidable cognitive dissonance. Greenfeld suggests the opposite.

You will have to come to terms with them - if you like to contemplate these things, or not.\n\nThe post and its author is a useful counter example to my own life's plan: A (relatively) small but reflected life in the here and now is more rewarding, more livable, more rational, more emotionally honest and also more ethically sound, than any sweeping pronouncements of a \"big life\"‚Ñ¢ could ever be.\n\nMy mental model predicts that sooner or later everyone will have to open their eyes to the small life they are actually living and embrace it - or failing that will live with a lot of avoidable cognitive dissonance. Greenfeld suggests the opposite. We'll see whose bet holds.\n\n- [Previously.](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/02/13/impermanence-and-improvement.html)\n",

				"content_html": "<p><em>TL;DR: In light of the growing importance of digital services, we ought to consider modern software quality in relation to its environmental impact as well. This is more easily possible thanks to using automated software quality tools and continuous integration.</em></p>\n<p>Being a programmer means being privileged: You&rsquo;re generally sought after, payed well and enjoy freedoms and perks that other workers could only dream of. I think this still is true even though there have been many tech lay-offs recently. It&rsquo;s not like programmers became obsolete. On average software developers have it pretty good.</p>\n<p>In any case, working in software development brings with it also a big responsibility: To at least ponder the consequences of our actions as an industry. Up to and including what that means for the industry in my country (and Europe as a whole in my case), my company, my team and myself.</p>\n<p>There are lots of things to consider like privacy issues, accessibility issues and - more and more, although it&rsquo;s not a new thing - environmental issues.</p>\n<p>Because of how the world works, even actually pondering those issues at work almost never happens. It&rsquo;s not really part of the discussion - lip service aside - when considering changes to a software system.</p>\n<p>I acknowledge the importance of all the ethical issues named und unnamed above, but want to concentrate on environmental issues here: The tech industry as a whole is constantly incentivized to offer and use more resources: It has become standard to expect new computers to be faster and so newer software tends to be more resource hungry than older software. What does that mean, exactly? Well, new hardware needs resources in production to make all the chips, cards, and so on, that&rsquo;s obvious to anyone. But resources are also needed  when using our hardware: A modern laptop generally doesn&rsquo;t require that much power to be used by us, but what about the internet? The data centers that host most of the services we use today and that make up a big part of our modern understanding of what using a computing device should feel like, are insanely resource hungry. Take this example of data centers using fresh water to cool its facilities:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In The Dalles, Oregon, Google was found to be using a quarter of the city‚Äôs water supply to cool its facilities. Tech companies have been facing pushback elsewhere in the United States, but also across the world in places like Uruguay, Chile, the Netherlands, Ireland, and New Zealand. Now opposition is growing in Spain too, where droughts are wiping out crops and people are wondering why they‚Äôd give their limited water resources to Meta for a data center.\n‚Äî <a href=\"https://www.disconnect.blog/p/the-chatgpt-revolution-is-another\">The ChatGPT revolution is another tech fantasy</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The French think tank &ldquo;the shift project&rdquo; <a href=\"https://theshiftproject.org/en/article/unsustainable-use-online-video/\">estimated</a>  that about 4% of green house gas emissions are the result of the use of digital services and that this figure grows by 9% every year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"automation-and-software-quality\">Automation and software quality</h3>\n<p>A modern software development workflow consists of many pieces, incorporates many different perspectives and hast to take a lot of concerns into account. After all, modern businesses model their processes in software, report, plan and reflect in software and are maybe even selling software products through software market places. Business processes tend to be very complex, simply by virtue of having to deal with historical ballast, future visions, differing politics within the company and a shifting environment in which the software has to function, not to speak of the process itself, which touches many different stake holders that all need different things from a company to do their work.</p>\n<p>Because of this, the software development cycle of gathering requirements, implementation, testing and release has started - more than 10 years ago - to accumulate lots of automation tools that are being referred to as continuous integration (ci). For example: When you develop software you often want to make sure that your new feature works as expected before you release a new version of your software. For this, people have developed testing tools. So people would write not only the feature but also a test (or tests) to make sure that the feature does what it should: This basically means you would define inputs and expected outputs and make sure that the new feature returns those expected values, when feeding the defined inputs. When a developer runs their test, they can see that the new feature works. This is great, but it&rsquo;s even greater when used down the road: Because a newer feature could accidentally change the behavior of a system in an unexpected way. With tests you can make sure that deployed code is more resilient against such accidental changes.</p>\n<p>An important part of modern development is the code review. So a developer would implement a feature, write tests and send their changes as a merge request (or pull request) to a colleague for review purposes. That colleague would check for any missed requirements, errors in the implementation, code smells and so on. There is a little back and forth between reviewer and programmer and if all is well the code is approved and can be deployed to a test system for a quality assurance colleague to manually test the change, before it then finally finds its way into the &ldquo;live&rdquo; software version used by a normal user.</p>\n<p>The code review process is especially important in terms of code quality, that is, in terms of aspects of the code that are rarely user facing but nonetheless are a very important part of a resilient application - scalable, easy to test, easy to change, etc. In other words: code review is supposed to help and (often times) ensure a high standard of quality in the codebase.</p>\n<p>Back to ci: Continuous integration can automatically find and often times fix a great many problems with new - and old, outdated - code. First of all, it can run all the software tests to ensure backwards compatibility. It can also run a linter, which ensures a consistent style (indentation, order of parts of code, naming scheme, etc.). This improves readability and ensures that a person familiar with one part of the system doesn&rsquo;t need to parse everything about this unknown part of the system: the files look the same and things are generally named as you would expect them to be, and so on.</p>\n<p>You can go further. You can let a static analysis tool run, to catch things like giving the wrong inputs to a function (e.g. input is a floating number, but this function expects an integer; in a dynamically typed language like PHP you might catch this error only when the code is actually run - but you want to catch that mistake and fix it before it is encountered in the wild). There are many, many other things where static analysis of a codebase in light of new changes can reveal problems that would otherwise go unnoticed until it&rsquo;s too late.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s automated testing, linting, static analysis and more tools like &ldquo;mess detectors&rdquo; that try to detect valid code but that constitutes generally considered bad programming practices. All of these tools would run before a code reviewer even gets to see the code. Issues with agreed upon standards will be brought up and fixed - in some cases even automatically - before another human even has to see the code. This in the end saves time, improves focus - because humans are not good in spotting standard violations and even prevents some lengthy discussions in some cases - because the machine is dispassionate and just enforces a standard that was agreed upon in the company.</p>\n<p>But you can go further. A relatively new idea is to also take software architecture into account when talking about ci. Software architecture is a whole can of worms in itself, but one important concern, as an example, is modularity: You want your code neatly organized so that the whole system stays open to replacement, improvement, extension, change, and so on. You could make sure, for example, that different parts of the system do not talk directly with each other, by defining application layers that separate different parts of the system from another to ensure a sensible organizational structure of the whole. Well, you can test for that in your ci pipeline - the pipeline is what runs all your defined code quality tools, linters and so on - as well, by defining an &ldquo;architectural fitness function&rdquo;:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the 2017 book Building Evolutionary Architectures (O‚ÄôReilly), the authors (Neal Ford, Rebecca Parsons, and Patrick Kua) defined the concept of an architectural fitness function: any mechanism that performs an objective integrity assessment of some architecture characteristic or combination of architecture characteristics.\n‚Äî <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-the/9781492086888/\">Software Architecture: The Hard Parts, &ldquo;Using Fitness Functions&rdquo;</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With a function defined you can also write a test in a tool like <a href=\"https://github.com/carlosas/phpat\">phpat</a>.

				"content_text": "*TL;DR: In light of the growing importance of digital services, we ought to consider modern software quality in relation to its environmental impact as well. This is more easily possible thanks to using automated software quality tools and continuous integration.*\n\nBeing a programmer means being privileged: You're generally sought after, payed well and enjoy freedoms and perks that other workers could only dream of. I think this still is true even though there have been many tech lay-offs recently. It's not like programmers became obsolete. On average software developers have it pretty good.\n\nIn any case, working in software development brings with it also a big responsibility: To at least ponder the consequences of our actions as an industry. Up to and including what that means for the industry in my country (and Europe as a whole in my case), my company, my team and myself.\n\nThere are lots of things to consider like privacy issues, accessibility issues and - more and more, although it's not a new thing - environmental issues.\n\nBecause of how the world works, even actually pondering those issues at work almost never happens. It's not really part of the discussion - lip service aside - when considering changes to a software system.\n\nI acknowledge the importance of all the ethical issues named und unnamed above, but want to concentrate on environmental issues here: The tech industry as a whole is constantly incentivized to offer and use more resources: It has become standard to expect new computers to be faster and so newer software tends to be more resource hungry than older software. What does that mean, exactly? Well, new hardware needs resources in production to make all the chips, cards, and so on, that's obvious to anyone. But resources are also needed  when using our hardware: A modern laptop generally doesn't require that much power to be used by us, but what about the internet? The data centers that host most of the services we use today and that make up a big part of our modern understanding of what using a computing device should feel like, are insanely resource hungry. Take this example of data centers using fresh water to cool its facilities: \n\n>In The Dalles, Oregon, Google was found to be using a quarter of the city‚Äôs water supply to cool its facilities. Tech companies have been facing pushback elsewhere in the United States, but also across the world in places like Uruguay, Chile, the Netherlands, Ireland, and New Zealand. Now opposition is growing in Spain too, where droughts are wiping out crops and people are wondering why they‚Äôd give their limited water resources to Meta for a data center.\n>‚Äî [The ChatGPT revolution is another tech fantasy](https://www.disconnect.blog/p/the-chatgpt-revolution-is-another)\n\nThe French think tank \"the shift project\" [estimated](https://theshiftproject.org/en/article/unsustainable-use-online-video/)  that about 4% of green house gas emissions are the result of the use of digital services and that this figure grows by 9% every year.\n\n### Automation and software quality\n\nA modern software development workflow consists of many pieces, incorporates many different perspectives and hast to take a lot of concerns into account. After all, modern businesses model their processes in software, report, plan and reflect in software and are maybe even selling software products through software market places. Business processes tend to be very complex, simply by virtue of having to deal with historical ballast, future visions, differing politics within the company and a shifting environment in which the software has to function, not to speak of the process itself, which touches many different stake holders that all need different things from a company to do their work.\n\nBecause of this, the software development cycle of gathering requirements, implementation, testing and release has started - more than 10 years ago - to accumulate lots of automation tools that are being referred to as continuous integration (ci). For example: When you develop software you often want to make sure that your new feature works as expected before you release a new version of your software. For this, people have developed testing tools. So people would write not only the feature but also a test (or tests) to make sure that the feature does what it should: This basically means you would define inputs and expected outputs and make sure that the new feature returns those expected values, when feeding the defined inputs. When a developer runs their test, they can see that the new feature works. This is great, but it's even greater when used down the road: Because a newer feature could accidentally change the behavior of a system in an unexpected way. With tests you can make sure that deployed code is more resilient against such accidental changes.\n\nAn important part of modern development is the code review. So a developer would implement a feature, write tests and send their changes as a merge request (or pull request) to a colleague for review purposes. That colleague would check for any missed requirements, errors in the implementation, code smells and so on. There is a little back and forth between reviewer and programmer and if all is well the code is approved and can be deployed to a test system for a quality assurance colleague to manually test the change, before it then finally finds its way into the \"live\" software version used by a normal user.\n\nThe code review process is especially important in terms of code quality, that is, in terms of aspects of the code that are rarely user facing but nonetheless are a very important part of a resilient application - scalable, easy to test, easy to change, etc. In other words: code review is supposed to help and (often times) ensure a high standard of quality in the codebase.\n\nBack to ci: Continuous integration can automatically find and often times fix a great many problems with new - and old, outdated - code. First of all, it can run all the software tests to ensure backwards compatibility. It can also run a linter, which ensures a consistent style (indentation, order of parts of code, naming scheme, etc.). This improves readability and ensures that a person familiar with one part of the system doesn't need to parse everything about this unknown part of the system: the files look the same and things are generally named as you would expect them to be, and so on.\n\nYou can go further. You can let a static analysis tool run, to catch things like giving the wrong inputs to a function (e.g. input is a floating number, but this function expects an integer; in a dynamically typed language like PHP you might catch this error only when the code is actually run - but you want to catch that mistake and fix it before it is encountered in the wild). There are many, many other things where static analysis of a codebase in light of new changes can reveal problems that would otherwise go unnoticed until it's too late.\n\nThere's automated testing, linting, static analysis and more tools like \"mess detectors\" that try to detect valid code but that constitutes generally considered bad programming practices. All of these tools would run before a code reviewer even gets to see the code. Issues with agreed upon standards will be brought up and fixed - in some cases even automatically - before another human even has to see the code. This in the end saves time, improves focus - because humans are not good in spotting standard violations and even prevents some lengthy discussions in some cases - because the machine is dispassionate and just enforces a standard that was agreed upon in the company.\n\nBut you can go further. A relatively new idea is to also take software architecture into account when talking about ci. Software architecture is a whole can of worms in itself, but one important concern, as an example, is modularity: You want your code neatly organized so that the whole system stays open to replacement, improvement, extension, change, and so on. You could make sure, for example, that different parts of the system do not talk directly with each other, by defining application layers that separate different parts of the system from another to ensure a sensible organizational structure of the whole. Well, you can test for that in your ci pipeline - the pipeline is what runs all your defined code quality tools, linters and so on - as well, by defining an \"architectural fitness function\":\n\n>In the 2017 book Building Evolutionary Architectures (O‚ÄôReilly), the authors (Neal Ford, Rebecca Parsons, and Patrick Kua) defined the concept of an architectural fitness function: any mechanism that performs an objective integrity assessment of some architecture characteristic or combination of architecture characteristics.\n‚Äî [Software Architecture: The Hard Parts, \"Using Fitness Functions\"](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-the/9781492086888/)\n\nWith a function defined you can also write a test in a tool like [phpat](https://github.com/carlosas/phpat). Here's an example from the readme of this project:\n\n```php\n<?php\n\nuse PHPat\\Selector\\Selector;\nuse PHPat\\Test\\Builder\\Rule;\nuse PHPat\\Test\\PHPat;\nuse App\\Domain\\SuperForbiddenClass;\n\nclass MyFirstTest\n{\n    public function test_domain_does_not_depend_on_other_layers(): Rule\n    {\n        return PHPat::rule()\n            ->classes(Selector::namespace('App\\Domain'))\n            ->shouldNotDependOn()\n            ->classes(\n                Selector::namespace('App\\Application'),\n                Selector::namespace('App\\Infrastructure'),\n                Selector::classname(SuperForbiddenClass::class),\n                Selector::classname('/^SomeVendor\\\\\\.*\\\\\\ForbiddenSubfolder\\\\\\.*/', true)\n            );\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd just as with your tests that are supposed to test that the code does what it does, you can test that it does so in an integrity conserving way with an architectural testing tool like this.\n\n### Automating measuring environmental impact\n\nBut you can do more: We started this discussion with pondering ethical issues and the impact a software developer's work has. You can now for example measure carbon footprint and energy consumption in a similar fashion in your ci pipeline as all the other things we have mentioned above. An example is [greenframe](https://github.com/marmelab/greenframe-cli) that does this for web apps.\n\nAs with all concerns: A measurement is only as good as the idea of what you're trying to measure.

What automation can do, though, is performing consistent measurements of your codebase, which you can then use to gauge the environmental software quality of your project.\n\n* * *\n\nThis wraps up this somewhat lengthy blog post.

Why the scope is not implied? I don&rsquo;t know.

If you look at <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/functions/\">the list of available functions in hugo</a>, you will know that a function was exported, but not why. Also a lot of functions were not exported, but you also do not know why. I assume that the lower case functions are all part of hugo&rsquo;s templating standard lib. But it&rsquo;s not explained what is going on in the docs explicitly.</li>\n<li><code> </code> - A space (yup). Functions and parameters are separated by spaces, so this space indicates the start of the Paginate function call (And not the parentheses in front of the <code>where</code>, as one might think when coming from other languages).</li>\n<li><code>(</code> - The start of the parentheses denotes a nested expression.</li>\n<li><code>where</code> - that&rsquo;s the <code>where</code> function which takes an array and compares a value at a given key using an operator (equals is implied and can be omitted like has been done here) to a value and only keeps the elements that pass the test.</li>\n<li><code>.Site.Pages.ByDate.Reverse</code> - The <code>.Site.Pages</code> part is an array of all pages of the blog. The <code>ByDate.Reverse</code> part is used (and available only) on <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/templates/lists/#what-is-a-list-page-template\">list pages</a> - another detail you&rsquo;ll have to know - that is pages that have other pages under them in the file hierarchy. AND that the homepage is a special kind of list page. This is a snippet from the home page, so you can use it here to change the order of the retrieved array. Why you can&rsquo;t retrieve pages in similar manner on non list pages is unclear to me.</li>\n<li><code>&quot;Type&quot;</code> - This is the key parameter of the <code>where</code> function. The key is &ldquo;Type&rdquo; here. Why is <code>Type</code> capitalized? Maybe it has to because of exports? Maybe it&rsquo;s some other reason that I don&rsquo;t know. In any case it is part of the keys of the element that is kept (or discarded). For the pages array an element includes things like a <code>Permalink</code>, a published <code>Date</code> and a also a <code>Type</code>. How do you know what an element includes? Well, it&rsquo;s hard to say, because the <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/templates/template-debugging/#what-variables-are-available-in-this-context\">proposed solution</a> to use something like <code>&amp;#123;&amp;#123; printf &quot;%#v&quot; . }}</code> within a range function call that references the pages from the <code>Paginator</code> above only prints garbage. An actual solution is to use <code>&lt;pre&gt;&amp;#123;&amp;#123; . | jsonify (dict &quot;indent&quot; &quot; &quot;) }}&lt;/pre&gt;</code> which gives a pretty printed JSON representation of all the available properties within a given context. But you&rsquo;ll not find this solution in the docs, you have to get lucky and find it in the forum or <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64163573/how-to-inspect-variables-in-the-current-scope-in-hugo\">Stack Overflow</a>.</li>\n<li><code>&quot;post&quot;</code> - this is the match parameter of the <code>where</code> function.

PR can - maybe! - help to establish some use cases or open the door, but it's the actual use that leads to an uptake in the likelihood of (mediated) activities. And that's where the difference lies. That in turn doesn't mean that PR is useless either. PR makes things appear pleasant, which is nice.\n\nComing back to AR/VR headsets: The problem of these technologies so far is that they do not make you play more games or take more meetings, or whatever. The technology is not persuasive enough to get over the uncanny valley. But, again, it's not the uncanny valley itself that make them unsuccessful so far.\n",

Many people (like me) want or indeed <em>need</em>  <a href=\"https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5WDNZizsbAzE1p2BLwr339fV4TCpzNvaztP2\">a writing surface to think</a>. Finding a good writing surface makes a real difference and PKM tools can be an incredible writing surface.</p>\n<p>Does this make them &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; for PKM? First, what actually is a PKM tool? A notebook? A piece of paper? An index card? A word document? The current crop of fancy note taking tools like Obsidian et. al. are mostly more sophisticated versions of simpler PKM tools that came before them.

Rather, knowledge management is a process of transforming data into information and then into knowledge through the application of cognitive processes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While PKM tools can be helpful in collecting, organizing, and connecting the information you gather, it is up to you to do something with that information to turn it into knowledge.</p>\n<footer>Eric Gregorich <cite><a href=\"https://ericgregorich.com/2023/04/02/heyscottyj-no-pkm.html\" class=\"u-in-reply-to\">https://ericgregorich.com/2023/04/02/heyscottyj-no-pkm.html</a></cite></footer></blockquote><script src=\"https://micro.blog/quoteback.js\"></script>\n\nI agree with Eric's point - [and have made a similar one recently](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2023/03/21/an-interesting-difference.html) - just gathering and organizing information is not knowledge.\n\nHowever, I feel that Scotty seems to throw out the baby with the bath water: Just because PKM tools are limited doesn't mean that they are useless. Many people (like me) want or indeed _need_  [a writing surface to think](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5WDNZizsbAzE1p2BLwr339fV4TCpzNvaztP2). Finding a good writing surface makes a real difference and PKM tools can be an incredible writing surface.\n\nDoes this make them \"necessary\" for PKM? First, what actually is a PKM tool? A notebook? A piece of paper? An index card? A word document? The current crop of fancy note taking tools like Obsidian et. al. are mostly more sophisticated versions of simpler PKM tools that came before them. So I'd say if we just talk about \"tools that help turn data into information and in turn into knowledge\" (obviously not on their own, I'll have to engage with the stuff in front of me) then, I'd say, they are indeed needed. If it is about the more sophisticated variants that have become popular over the last few years, then I think the question can be answered with a \"no, but\". The \"but\" part here would make an argument about convenience but also elaborative power.\n\nIt can be very convenient to use a modern tool like Obsidian and although not strictly neccessary, working with it is just very _nice_. As is using an iPhone (in my experience) or a sharp knife. Having a nice tool, makes me want to use the tool more, therefore engaging me with what I have gathered before, which in turn makes it more likely that I'll acquire knowledge in the process.\n\nMore sophisticated PKM tools have, generally speaking, more elaborative power. If I can view and connect an idea in many different ways with ease, I am engaging with the information at hand, making it more easily retrievable. In other words these actions make it more likely I learn how it fits with other things I know already. This is what learning is: trying to understand, trying to get at the ideas behind the information and finding a \"fit\" within the greater universe of concepts and ideas I already know.

				"content_html": "<blockquote>\n<p>Part of my depression is a degree of apathy; the more I can focus and get excited about something the more I feel I&rsquo;m on the right path. I do worry, however, that it&rsquo;s a mask and I&rsquo;m just distracting myself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And that&rsquo;s how I feel about all this in a wider context. Treatment and therapy don&rsquo;t magically make you a happy person. Instead, they mask the symptoms or provide better coping strategies, ways to head off the worst of it before it can take hold.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://colinwalker.blog/blog/?date=2023-03-15#p1\">Colin Walker.</a></p>\n<p>As somebody who has had several mental health breakdowns and three therapists in my 20s (I&rsquo;m 36 now), my current perspective on therapy is that you create the world in which you&rsquo;re living in and therapy can give structure (and meds, if needed) towards creating a livable world, for you. Meaning that you are actually not just getting rid of yet another veil that makes you see things more clearly - or on the contrary putting another mask on to make you see things less clearly. Instead your world can&rsquo;t literaly be anything else than what you focus on. If you&rsquo;re focussing on being happy, coping and so on, chances are that your world &ldquo;becomes&rdquo; what you see.</p>\n<p>This is not as simple as just using willpower, however. Not least, because willpower is like a muscle and ego depletion is a real thing. It&rsquo;s also because depression can be thought of as an an active but independently acting agent in your consciousness: Deciding to want to focus on something else is important, but a mental illness wouldn&rsquo;t be called that, if you could &lsquo;just decide&rsquo; and stick to counteracting it.</p>\n<p>This is where therapy can be incredibly helpful: In my experience visiting with a therapist changes your environment, your habits, which is itself - not even taking into account their skill at treating you - an important step to creating lasting behavioral change. But therapists offer also structure on top of just existing in your environment. In my experience they offer a source of serendipity that makes it possible to reach break throughs, new frames of thinking, new ways of looking at things. By showing up and interacting with a therapist you&rsquo;re making a real effort to change what you believe to be the boundaries of your current situation. Yes, this can be in the form of recipe-like  coping strategies, but it can also just mean to interact with an expert on mental health. And that communication has a very high likelihood of being <em>surprising</em> - which is so important to feel something, anything <em>else</em> as regards to your current mental health.</p>\n<p>So in short: We are and our world is what we are focussing on. There is no trick here. Nothing is revealed or hidden by engaging differently with the world, instead it is just that: A different perspective, a different world. To make a sustained effort to change this perspective for good means to change the environment (because willpower alone won&rsquo;t cut it) and to being open to be surprised.</p>\n<p>Medicine can really help in some cases. But even then it&rsquo;s not guaranteed that your conscience is built to accommodate even one new way of perceiving the world that doesn&rsquo;t include your mental illness. People are different, they can and can&rsquo;t do different things. A goal for one person to be completely healed from depression might just simply not be in the cards for others. <em>However</em>: Even temporary relief or a more manageable severity of symptoms might be totally worth the effort.</p>\n<p>Finally, there is no relief in thinking that you may never find relief and therefore doing nothing. I would like to say: Whole-ass the thing, but I don&rsquo;t mean it to say &ldquo;don&rsquo;t do anything else&rdquo;, I mean it in the sense that if you&rsquo;re doing therapy, take it seriously, treat is as a creative task. The task of reinventing your world.</p>\n",

It's also because depression can be thought of as an an active but independently acting agent in your consciousness: Deciding to want to focus on something else is important, but a mental illness wouldn't be called that, if you could 'just decide' and stick to counteracting it.\n\nThis is where therapy can be incredibly helpful: In my experience visiting with a therapist changes your environment, your habits, which is itself - not even taking into account their skill at treating you - an important step to creating lasting behavioral change. But therapists offer also structure on top of just existing in your environment. In my experience they offer a source of serendipity that makes it possible to reach break throughs, new frames of thinking, new ways of looking at things. By showing up and interacting with a therapist you're making a real effort to change what you believe to be the boundaries of your current situation. Yes, this can be in the form of recipe-like  coping strategies, but it can also just mean to interact with an expert on mental health. And that communication has a very high likelihood of being _surprising_ - which is so important to feel something, anything _else_ as regards to your current mental health.\n\nSo in short: We are and our world is what we are focussing on. There is no trick here. Nothing is revealed or hidden by engaging differently with the world, instead it is just that: A different perspective, a different world. To make a sustained effort to change this perspective for good means to change the environment (because willpower alone won't cut it) and to being open to be surprised.\n\nMedicine can really help in some cases. But even then it's not guaranteed that your conscience is built to accommodate even one new way of perceiving the world that doesn't include your mental illness. People are different, they can and can't do different things. A goal for one person to be completely healed from depression might just simply not be in the cards for others. _However_: Even temporary relief or a more manageable severity of symptoms might be totally worth the effort.\n\nFinally, there is no relief in thinking that you may never find relief and therefore doing nothing. I would like to say: Whole-ass the thing, but I don't mean it to say \"don't do anything else\", I mean it in the sense that if you're doing therapy, take it seriously, treat is as a creative task. The task of reinventing your world.\n",

I feel like I ought to be capable enough to make things (bring side projects to a &ldquo;version 1&rdquo; state, continuously publish side projects that are ongoing, like newsletters), change or add habits, transform my surroundings in a positive manner, etc. I feel like I should be able to succeed sometimes, at least.</p>\n<p>Let me say it again: Despite what I just wrote, I do appreciate that I have not stood still and it would be wrong to claim that nothing good came out of me trying hard in whatever it may have been.

I feel like this makes me good at my job. It actually makes me good at <em>life</em> I&rsquo;ll claim, because my reflections are more mature and I do know myself better than without. The question is though: If I&rsquo;m so great, where are the results of me being good? I&rsquo;m a middling programmer - I do recognize that I started my career later than others and I know that I have not reached my ceiling and am far from it: I even made steps forward to becoming more proficient.

				"content_text": "<p>The more I read about how mastodon works, the happier I am that I ended up being so curious about the publishing options in <a href=\"https://ia.net/writer\">iA Writer</a> that I had to check out micro.blog about 1.5 years ago.</p>\n<p>Don't get me wrong: It's great that people are checking out mastodon. <a href=\"https://help.micro.blog/t/activitypub/95\">It lets me follow them on micro.blog.</a> But moderation and all the other social aspects of running a social network (even if it's \"just\" a timeline of blogs) are what's hard.</p>\n<p>Many people that are leaving Twitter right now (or at least create a mastodon account on the side, for the time after Twitter finally implodes) end up on <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/explore\">mastodon.social</a>, the biggest mastodon instance there is. When I scrolled through their explore timeline I was surprised to find a post by fellow corgi lover and micro.blogger Hollie Butler (<a href=\"https://micro.blog/hollie\">@hollie</a>) that urged people to find a better instance, because mastodon.social has had a bad moderation for a long time.</p>\n<p>In the replies to this post a user asked: Can I move my content over to a new (e.g. better moderated) instance? The answer is no. You can move the people you follow, but not your content, it seems.</p>\n<p>With micro.blog this combination of problems doesn't really exist. On the one hand they have and enforce community guidelines that protect the community against hate speech, harassment and so on. Community manager Jean MacDonald (<a href=\"https://micro.blog/jean\">@jean</a>) does an excellent job as far as I can tell. So there is no reason to move. Micro.blog is just a blog hoster with a social timeline component.</p>\n<p>On the other hand exporting your data is easy enough, too. Even if there would be a reason at some point to move: I do own all my content and it's not useless content, because a micro.blog is just a blog and so the content I'd export are just blog posts.</p>\n<p>The point is: At the moment micro.blog seems like the ideal place that is not twitter, but has moderation figured out (and still lets you connect to mastodon users). I feel like I'm in good hands with them. If you're willing to fiddle, you can connect your own blog for free, or you could pay them 5$ a month and have everything set up for you. Connect a domain and you really truly own your content, even in the case you feel the need to move away, since the permalinks point to your domain not micro.blog's (<a href=\"https://help.micro.blog/t/moving-micro-blog-hosted-blog-to-self-hosted/1201\">I'm not claiming the moving blog hosters is easy, but it's possible‚Ä¶</a>).</p>\n",

Wether it is note taking or coding, gaming or just watching youtube: I really like to use my Mac more than I like my iPad. The iPad is strictly better for cooking and is used frequently for that, but I have not used the machine to its full potential. I have noticed that I'm a very stationary person and like my current desk setup (private laptop on the left, KVM-enabled Display in the middle, work laptop on the right, <a href=\"https://ergodox-ez.com/\">Ergodox EZ</a> as my keyboard and Logitech MX Master 3 as my mouse), which doesn't include a real place for an iPad. I rarely work on the kitchen table - the only other spot really usable for writing/sitting down to do computer things in my home.¬†Even when I'm traveling it's the laptop not the tablet that gets used.</p>\n<p>That being said I'm happy about owning an iPad Pro, too. I use it frequently enough to make it worth the purchase, even if I'm a light user of it. Next time around I probably would get a cheaper, more basic model. The Air is just plainly a great computer and I can't even conceive a justification for wanting more out of a private computer (which gets used for 1 to 8 hours a day, depending on if it's the weekend or free time after work).</p>\n",

I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúlive‚Äù in my notes as much as I like to do.</p>\n<p>Another big reason for being fine with paying the price of maintaining things myself is the recent development of Obsidian: it now supports multiple windows, something that Agenda lacks and something that makes distilling a bunch of notes into a new one pretty hard.</p>\n<p>Finally, I think that working on plugins for Obsidian is a way to lessen the load of maintenance and - since I‚Äôm a developer - a way to actually gain some expertise. So in my case, it is not a terrible investment of time and effort.</p>\n<p>¬†</p>\n",

What I'm struggling with is too much scaffolding.</p>\n<p>Now, I also know about the willpower/structure problem: Relying on willpower to do something is bound to fail in the long run, whereas putting structures in place that foster me to do the right thing, if I want it or not, is the sustainable choice.</p>\n<p>But: Even structures like task managers can be or become a source of ego depletion, which is exactly the opposite of what they are supposed to be.</p>\n<p>And so I strive for a kind of intuitive and mostly maintenance-free productivity setup: Give me a structured writing surface like <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/08/22/good-apps-agenda.html\">Agenda</a> (Agenda is a very nice garbage bin for notes that don't really matter), remind me to do things when it is absolutely necessary by using <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/01/22/good-apps-due.html\">Due</a>. Otherwise either rely on the project management tools at work (tickets and kanban board) or use Reminders to make sure that things that need to be done but are not work in progress and/or are not work related won't be forgotten.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>The best feature is one that is provided and maintained by the platform. A feature that can be built using an API or through extensions/plugins is of course better than a feature that does not exist all. But: Building a feature means maintaining a feature.</p>\n<p>An example: You can cobble together a functioning journaling/project notes solution, with daily, weekly and other periodic notes in <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/02/27/good-apps-obsidian.html\">Obsidian</a> (using a handful of plugins and a carefully thought through file organization scheme). That works. You just have to remember how everything works the next time you touch that part of your setup. And hope that nothing breaks, between those loosely coupled building blocks and the next update. Or you could just use <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/08/22/good-apps-agenda.html\">Agenda</a>. Is Agenda perfect? No. But it is much more well suited out of the box for this kind of note taking.</p>\n<p>There is also a risk of drift: If you're trying to organize your notes, you probably don't do so just for the sake of it, but because you try to become better at doing other things. The notes and also the notes setup are just helping to accomplish a task at hand. If your setup is complicated and some parts are even written by yourself, you might end up accomplishing everything else but the task you set out to check off in the first place.</p>\n<p>Therefore, when I try to improve my current system, I always look for ways to use a less customized system. The more stock features I use the better. The burden of maintaining those features lies with the app developer.</p>\n<p>Of course, there will be lots of cases where a feature just doesn't exist. In that case I try to live without this feature first. Maybe I don't need it as much as I first thought. If I can't live without it, I look for a plugin solution, again, to lessen the maintenance load on myself. I have to be aware, that I may not need to maintain the plugin providing the feature, but I am now responsible to make it all work, i.e. the burden of maintenance of the integration of plugin and setup lies with me.</p>\n<p>Finally, I might write a plugin, script or customize an existing piece of code to make it do what I need it to do, but this is really a last resort. Very often this is not worth the time.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>My note taking system consists of three different pieces:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Timeless notes: Ideas, thoughts, etc. that are interlinked and are not time sensitive. These are often literally the base of knowledge from which I work. Here I try to distill what I have learned and try to push myself toward the new and the more generalized.</li>\n<li>Project notes: Status quos, todos and thoughts related to ongoing projects or tasks that have some kind of momentum but are more ephemeral than timeless notes.</li>\n<li>Journal notes: Notes that record what is happening or has happened so that I have a written record of aspects of my lived life.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Types 2 and 3 are very much related, although different in the sense, that a type 2 note is not necessarily interesting enough to be mentioned in a type 3 note. And a type 3 note is not so concerned with creating or maintaining momentum, but more with creating a record of what happened.</p>\n<p>Type one notes are different in the sense that they should be more interlinked and add up to trees of notes that in turn act serendipity-enhancing on the interface between thinking and writing (including coding). You want to treat those kinds of notes differently and keep them separate. This is where the good stuff lives. Insights from type 2 and 3 notes might end up becoming a type 1 note.</p>\n<p>A type 1 note is not the place to keep a record, though. It represents my latest stance on a topic, the latest formulation of an idea. They exist to be refactored and to be changed in any way that seems appropriate.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I work as a programmer for my day job. Right now I am working on two php projects. Coming from <a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com\">Sublime Text</a>¬†but having had the need for more IDE features I came to love <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com\">Visual Studio Code</a> and made it my home. VS Code is a great editor for PHP development, especially if you use the <a href=\"https://intelephense.com\">Intelephense</a> extension. However, the bigger the project, the more it becomes apparent, that the performance of the language server is not <em>that</em> great.</p>\n<p>I lived with this for many months now. Yesterday I started working on a new issue and thought to myself: ‚ÄúAll of my dev team members use <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/\">Jetbrains PHPStorm</a>, I should give it a try.‚Äù. I had used <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/\">Jetbrains Intelij Idea</a> for a brief moment a while back and only remembered being fairly unimpressed, but not exactly why I felt that way. Having now tried getting into their PHP IDE product, I have to say my impression has not really changed and now I also remember why.</p>\n<p>Although the code intelligence performance is clearly better, it is the small stuff that gets me. The impetus for this post for example was that you can‚Äôt use standard shell shortcuts with the integrated terminal: <code>Control + R</code> (backwards history search) being one of my most often used commands.</p>\n<p>I appreciated that they offer a keymap for people coming from Code to PHPStorm and as far as I can tell, the commands in it work. But customizing an IDE is more than just having the same default shortcuts for common tasks available in the new app. I have a bunch of my own shortcuts in code that use the pattern <code>CMD + H &lt;Key&gt;</code> (press <code>CMD + H</code> and then <code>&lt;Key&gt;</code>). I use <code>CMD + H</code>, because my last name start with H, so it was (and is) easier to remember. It just so happens that <code>CMD + H</code> is also a system wide shortcut for hiding an application. So when I tried to set up a frequently used shortcut to reveal the currently opened file in the sidebar navigation, <code>CMD + H S</code> the PHPStorm app was just hidden. In other words it did not ‚Äúshadow‚Äù or override system shortcuts when asked. This feels even more arbitrary if we take those two things together: On the one hand standard shortcuts of the shell running inside the integrated terminal are shadowed per default - and this can also not be disabled - ¬†and on the other hand wanting to shadow a system wide shortcut like <code>CMD + H</code> is not possible without remapping the shortcut within the OS. I feel like the IDE is not really playing along, but instead makes me jump through hoops.</p>\n<p>These are only two compounding cuts of a thousand that make PHPStorm hard to love in my opinion. I have an especially hard time understanding the design decisions to remove long standing functionality from a shell by shadowing standard shortcuts. It‚Äôs just a bad idea. It does explain why my colleagues never use the integrated terminal, but have an extra shell window open to the side, to run terminal commands.</p>\n<p>All in all I am very unimpressed by PHPStorm, but also worried: If the performance of Intelephense stays as bad much longer, I might have to look at other options. I know that Netbeans and Eclipse also have PHP features, I just don‚Äôt know anyone using, let alone loving these apps for PHP development‚Ä¶</p>\n\n[Forward.](https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2023/07/10/phpstorms-keybinding-system.html)\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I recently bought new hardware for my personal use: An M1 MacBook Air and an 11‚Äù iPad Pro. My thoughts after the keynote:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I couldn‚Äôt be more excited about the new iPadOS features</li>\n<li>I am slightly sad that the two new MacBook models - the new M2 MacBook Air and the new 13-inch MacBook Pro - would have been options for my needs and budget</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since the iPad Pro was supposed to be my main machine - not least because I wanted to see if that is possible and fun - I‚Äôm even more excited to double down on that. Yeah, I just bought the older MacBook Air, but I bought it because I assume that the light coding I‚Äôm doing in my free time and the heavier reading/writing/note taking/processing workflow I have, will lead me to use a machine that can run a less walled in OS with multitasking capabilities. We‚Äôll see.</p>\n<p>I wonder if I would have picked a beefier M2 Air over my two machine solution, but I‚Äôm also happy I got both devices. We live in a time of exciting technology in which we can pick the right digital tool for the job at hand and I‚Äôm happy that I can experience this exciting future.</p>\n<p>In any case: My new hardware - I‚Äôm still waiting on my new Air - is/is going to be an amazing upgrade to my technological status quo. My personal laptop has been a 13-inch Mac Pro from 2013. And although that computer is still working (I just upgraded it to Monterey this morning!), it was time to upgrade. I‚Äôm really looking forward to leaving the sluggish, syrupy Mac experience behind.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/10/24/previously-after-using.html\">My thoughts after a few months of use</a></p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I think notifications are a rich vein for thinking about my setup, because it requires me to be clear about my intentions as regards to what I want to be notified about and where (and how and when).</p>\n<h2 id=\"analyzingtheproblemspace\">Analyzing The Problem Space</h2>\n<p>A notification is a way to let me know that something has happened, will happen, is available. It is an event that can interact with me and potentially makes me do things. It‚Äôs a trigger (or cue).</p>\n<p>Notifications can be desirable, overwhelming, unhelpful or outright spam. They are not inherently good or bad, but they are not a neutral thing in the world either: They make a difference.</p>\n<p>Judging the usefulness of a notification is a involved process. The complexity of getting notifications right increases when realizing that you have to set them up beforehand, which means you have to expect the future.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1.whatdoyounotwanttomiss-notwantingtomisssomethingdoesn‚Äôtmeanyouneedtoknowaboutitimmediately.\">1. What do you not want to miss? - Not wanting to miss something doesn‚Äôt mean you need to know about it immediately.</h3>\n<p>Missing something means that a change of state in my world passed me by. Notification, on or not: If I missed it, the knowledge of having missed it implies that I now know that my world has changed (it) and I noticed afterwards. For things I don‚Äôt want to miss, I am interested in the changed state of affairs. But this doesn‚Äôt mean that I need to know about it now.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2.isthechangeofstateinitselfimportant-achangeofthestatusquodoesn‚Äôtnecessarilymeantheinfoisgoingtoberelevantforeverorrelevanttemporarily.\">2. Is the change of state in itself important? - A change of the status quo doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean the info is going to be relevant forever (or relevant temporarily).</h3>\n<p>As compared to the things I don‚Äôt want to miss, here I‚Äôm more interested in the change of state: Something became available. A window of obligation/opportunity opened (or is about to close). Something was like <em>this</em> now it‚Äôs like <em>that</em>. Depending on the change, I might be interested in it forever or only for a limited period. In either case, time sensitivity itself is not the same as a change of state. It‚Äôs another property that alters this one.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3.howtimesensitiveisit-timesensitivityisnotthesameastheimportanceofthechangeoccurringortheimportanceofthenewstatusquo.\">3. How time sensitive is it? - Time sensitivity is not the same as the importance of the change occurring or the importance of the new status quo.</h3>\n<p>Time sensitivity doesn‚Äôt mean any change of state needs to be known now. Sometimes it needs to be known depending on a location or on a certain date and time. ‚ÄúNow‚Äù is one, but not the only possibility. The reasons for a notification being time sensitive can be manifold in practice. Abstractly speaking, it is a question of priority and urgency - which are also not the same thing.</p>\n<p>Whilst priority is trying to rank items by importance (which itself is a relative measure of impactfulness of the thing in question) to my world, urgency re-ranks those items according to currently open windows of opportunity and/or obligation.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Not only is it hard to keep all these distinctions in mind when I‚Äôm trying to predict my future, I‚Äôm also prone to getting it wrong, because my world is not made of numbers. Parts of my world aren‚Äôt measurable, some parts are not even comparable. Still other parts might not even be identifiable as parts!</p>\n<p>And if this wasn‚Äôt making it difficult enough, this is surely not even close to a complete description of the problem space and none of this is available to me objectively, either. So what to do?</p>\n<h2 id=\"keepingitsimple\">Keeping It Simple</h2>\n<h3 id=\"understandthenotificationsystemofyoursetup\">Understand the notification system of your setup</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm an Apple user and have an iPhone, a work Mac, a personal Mac and an iPad. For me, it was important to understand that while focus modes can be shared across devices, the per-app notification settings are not.</p>\n<p>Which makes sense, since not every app is available, let alone installed on every device.</p>\n<p>Some notification specific settings are adjusted within the app itself, while others are adjusted through the settings of the os.</p>\n<h3 id=\"startwithnonotificationsbadgesanything\">Start with no notifications, badges, anything</h3>\n<p>By disabling all notifications (individually), I am making sure that noise doesn‚Äôt even reach me. The default answer to any new app asking for permission to push notifications to me is ‚ÄúNo‚Äù.</p>\n<p>Same goes for badges, space on my home screen, or an app even getting installed. By radically reducing the apps that I have to manage, I reduce the problem a lot, by following this principled approach.</p>\n<h3 id=\"trytheleastdistractingsimplethingfirst\">Try the least distracting, simple thing first</h3>\n<p>I knew some apps needed some way to inform me. And although my analysis above was important to get a feel for the difficulty of the problem, an 80% solution for 20% of effort may be good enough in practice. So I try that first for any app that actually really needs to inform me.</p>\n<p>The harder part of this heuristic is figuring out what the least distracting thing is. I find a badge count of the right measure to be pretty good. But sometimes, actual notifications on one or more devices might be the obvious choice.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ifidon‚Äôtactonitiremoveit\">If I don‚Äôt act on it, I remove it</h3>\n<p>If something is only noise to me, it‚Äôs not worth getting informed about. Remove, simplify.</p>\n<h3 id=\"managethebaselinefirst\">Manage the baseline first</h3>\n<p>Before even getting into things like focus modes, I make sure my baseline of notifications has a high average of usefulness. This is hard to measure. A good quick test is maybe if notification center is a useful place to me, or not. I tinker with the baseline <em>before</em> I‚Äôm even introducing new focus modes (which add extra complexity).</p>\n<h3 id=\"usefocusmodessparingly\">Use focus modes sparingly</h3>\n<p>I currently have the following focus modes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>‚ÄúSleep‚Äù - for the night</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>‚ÄúWork‚Äù - for working</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>‚ÄúDo Not Disturb‚Äù - for when I need to focus or can not be disturbed (except in extraordinary circumstances).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I recently published a post about my <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/05/15/my-microcasts.html\">microcasts</a> and I‚Äòm now writing this to tell you I‚Äôm going to microcast less. Less frequent and less scheduled. This is even weirder because I just created an intricate shortcut that automatically publishes a post with the right episode title and number without having to look up any of those details, which streamlined the entire process a lot.</p>\n\n<p>But I have noticed that I‚Äòm not as much in the mood at the moment to record my thoughts in this way. <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/categories/the-early-riser/\">The early riser project</a>, for example, was a great McGuffin to get me out of bed, but since I have changed my approach to waking up, it has become less important to me. I don‚Äòt want to record these little episodes for the ramblings alone.</p>\n\n<p>Being a big fan of podcasts like <a href=\"https://www.backtowork.limo\">Back To Work</a> and <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/cortex\">Cortex</a>, I thought I could do a microcast about my work and how I approach it, but I have noticed that I would like to write about these things, not only talk about them extemporaenously. LeadDev is also the microcast for which the ratio of recorded/published episodes is the worst: I take this as an indicator of my wanting to express myself more carefully than I can while walking the dog and having to observe the environment.</p>\n\n<p>√Ä propos the dog: I created my first microcast, the PuppyCast, because I wanted to have a record of the challenges and joys of raising a puppy. I wanted to look (<a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/categories/dailydogo/\">DailyDoogo</a>, which I will not abandon, btw.) and listen back to this important time in my life. But I think that this project has run its course: I don‚Äòt feel the need to publish this every week anymore. It‚Äòs not like nothing changes or that there is nothing to report dog-wise, but it all comes down to the need to simplify and de-schedule my life. And I have episodes for the first six months, which seems like a good place to stop.</p>\n\n<p>Seasons change. And this is how I feel about my microcasting: Right now I‚Äòd much rather write than talk. Looking at my blog I mostly see noise that was produced hastily to satisfy a self-imposed schedule. I will let this stuff go, for now.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><a href=\"https://obsidian.md\">Obsidian</a> is a personal knowledge base and note taking app with a lot of flexibility and extensions that make it very powerful. If you like to <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/01/23/notes-on-notes.html\">take notes</a> and be in control of your data, then Obsidian might be the right fit.</p>\n<p>What makes Obsidian so valuable for me is that it allows me to consolidate a lot of things into one app. Like information about a project and its tasks. Reference materials about sociology and solutions to programming problems. Everything can be made to fit into Obsidian and thanks to its extensibility and configurability, the app can be adapted to my evolving needs over time.</p>\n<p>Most people point out that Obsidian is an app for people who like to <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/01/23/103518.html\">link their notes together</a>. If you rename a note in Obsidian, all the links to it will be renamed, too. Linking notes, so that they become chains and/or trees of notes unlocks emergent qualities that you wouldn‚Äôt be able to access without linking them.<a id=\"fnref:1\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"see footnote\" href=\"#fn:1\">[1]</a> It is also available as an iPhone app, that can do almost all the things that the Mac app can do. So you can take all your stuff with you as well.</p>\n<p>Obsidian might not be for you, because it might just be a little bit too much. But it might also just be the tool you were looking for. If you happen to have a tendency to react skeptically to overly hyped apps like this one: Ignore the knowledge graph visualization stuff<a id=\"fnref:2\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"see footnote\" href=\"#fn:2\">[2]</a> and also the personal knowledge base singularity talk and just try it out. Obsidian is great. Don‚Äôt let the sometimes overly boastful rhetoric in this space keep you from at least trying it.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\"><hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>For example: You will find notes that, taken together, inspire a new creative thought. You might also rediscover an old solution to a problem you currently have. Or you might notice a pattern in otherwise disparate information. <a class=\"reversefootnote\" title=\"return to article\" href=\"#fnref:1\">¬†‚Ü©</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\">\n<p>I think that visualizing one‚Äôs notes <em>could</em> at some point be helpful for maintaining and refactoring, but we are not there, yet. <a class=\"reversefootnote\" title=\"return to article\" href=\"#fnref:2\">¬†‚Ü©</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>In January I did a yearly Review and planning session, a thing I always try to do every year.</p>\n\n<p>This year I have the following goals and ideas which I'd like to try out:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Becoming an early riser - Status Quo: Big success! So much more time<sup><a href=\"#fn1-22434\" id=\"fnr1-22434\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> to do my projects. Se also my unter two minutes podcast <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/categories/the-early-riser/\">\"The Early Riser\"</a> that I record every single morning right after I have woken up.</li>\n<li>\"I will start\" - Explanation: Be the one who initiates communication, anticipate things to do before anybody has to bring them up - Status: Eh. Could be better, but I am not so bothered by this.</li>\n<li>Evidence-based living - Explanation: <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/01/19/080216.html\">Track things</a> and find metrics to make more informed decisions about different areas in my life.</li>\n<li>\"Commit\" - Explanation: Inspired by <a href=\"https://www.oliverburkeman.com/books\">4000 Weeks</a>, I'll try to commit to only three work-in-progress items at a time and if I'm committed try to bring those things to an end that is satisfactory while also resisting other demands - internally or externally - on me and my time and attention. Status: Okay, actually.</li>\n<li>\"Read and Write more\" - Status: Meh. I am trying, though. I found that playing around with <a href=\"https://readwise.io\">Readwise</a><sup><a href=\"#fn2-22434\" id=\"fnr2-22434\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> has motivated me to do more in this regard.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-22434\">\n<p>A day has only 24 Hours, so how is changing the start of the day making a difference? It's all about not snoozing and using time in bed effectively. If you need 10 hours in bed to get 6 hours of sleep that's not very effective. On the other hand: If you sleep 7 hours while laying in bed for 8 that's pretty good. Changing my sleep schedule made me a more effective sleeper. <a href=\"#fnr1-22434\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn2-22434\">\n<p>I can't decide if it's a great thing or overpriced, yet. [EDIT: <a href=\"https://blog.martin-haehnel.de/2022/02/13/my-current-highlighting.html\">I have decided that I like it. A lot.</a>] But I have noticed the little boost of interest of doing more reading (and re-reading) with every resurfaced highlight. So maybe it'll end up being worth it. <a href=\"#fnr2-22434\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

Plugin-Themes now behave much more convenient: Just install the theme, activate for your blog, create a custom theme and only add <code>config/_default/markup.json</code> template.</p>\n<p><del>First of all make sure you are on the Hugo version 0.91 (dropdown in the Design screen, remember to save) and install the default theme as a plugin (Plug-ins screen). Then go to Design again and click on &ldquo;Edit Custom Themes&rdquo;, on the next screen click on the default theme and duplicate it with the button in the next screen. You should now be back in the custom themes overview list. Click Design in the sidebar once more and choose your custom theme, save. Click &ldquo;Edit Custom Themes&rdquo; again and then on your copy of the Default theme.[^1]</del></p>\n<h2 id=\"change-configuration\">Change Configuration</h2>\n<p>You should now be inside your custom theme screen.

				"content_text": "If you are one of [the brave people](https://www.manton.org/2022/01/07/moving-to-new.html) that uses Hugo Version 0.91 and wants to take advantage of Hugo's [native syntax highlighting](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/) capabilities on a light theme (like the default theme in this example), you might be surprised:\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/44388/2022/f32609ded9.png)\n\nAs you can see‚Ä¶ you can't really see much.\n\nThankfully this can be changed, by changing the configuration for syntax highlighting. But in order to do that you have to know the following:\n\n<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" data-title=\"\" data-author=\"Jason Cardwell\" data-avatar=\"https://micro.blog/Moondeer/avatar.jpg\" cite=\"https://micro.blog/Moondeer/12348161\"><p><a href=\"https://micro.blog/matti\">[@matti](https://micro.blog/matti)</a> interesting ‚Ä¶ so much is still a blackbox for me. I just tinker until I get results. My two favorite finds are the config directory (which take precedent ahead of the json files) and the assets directory (with which you can build Javascript and Sass files from templates).</p>\n<footer>Jason Cardwell <cite><a href=\"https://micro.blog/Moondeer/12348161\">https://micro.blog/Moondeer/12348161</a></cite></footer></blockquote><script src=\"https://micro.blog/quoteback.js\"></script>\n\nYou have to know about the precedence because for some reason, changing the config.json in your theme won't do the trick. This is how it works:\n\n## Get A Functioning Custom \"New-Plugin-Style\"-Default-Theme For Your Blog\n\nEDIT 18.02.2022: The following is not up to date anymore. Plugin-Themes now behave much more convenient: Just install the theme, activate for your blog, create a custom theme and only add `config/_default/markup.json` template.\n\n~~First of all make sure you are on the Hugo version 0.91 (dropdown in the Design screen, remember to save) and install the default theme as a plugin (Plug-ins screen). Then go to Design again and click on \"Edit Custom Themes\", on the next screen click on the default theme and duplicate it with the button in the next screen. You should now be back in the custom themes overview list. Click Design in the sidebar once more and choose your custom theme, save. Click \"Edit Custom Themes\" again and then on your copy of the Default theme.[^1]~~\n\n\n## Change Configuration\n\nYou should now be inside your custom theme screen. Click on \"New Template\". You will be presented wie the template editor and theme preview split view.\n\nName the template `config/_default/markup.json` and set its contents to:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"highlight\": {\n      \"anchorLineNos\": false,\n      \"codeFences\": true,\n      \"guessSyntax\": false,\n      \"hl_Lines\": \"\",\n      \"lineAnchors\": \"\",\n      \"lineNoStart\": 1,\n      \"lineNos\": true,\n      \"lineNumbersInTable\": true,\n      \"noClasses\": true,\n      \"style\": \"monokailight\",\n      \"tabWidth\": 4\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nThis is basically the [default config from the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration-markup#highlight), except that for style we use `monokailight` instead of `monokay`. Click \"Update Template\", your site should be rebuilding as indicated by the spinner. When Hugo is done, syntax highlighting should now be working as intended and the code be legible.\n\nExample:\n\n```go-html-template\n{{ define \"main\" }}\n<div class=\"home h-feed\">\n  <ul class=\"post-list\">\n  {{ $paginator := .Paginate (where (where .Site.RegularPages.ByDate.Reverse \"Type\" \"post\") \"Params.title\" \"!=\" nil   ) (index .Site.Params \"archive-paginate\" | default 25) }}\n  {{ range $paginator.Pages  }}\n      <li class=\"h-entry\">\n\t\t\t<h1><a href=\"{{ .Permalink }}\">{{ .Title }}</a></h1>\n\n        <a href=\"{{ .Permalink }}\" class=\"u-url\"><span class=\"post-meta\"><time class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"{{ .Date.Format \"2006-01-02 15:04:05 -0700\" }}\">{{ .Date.Format \"Jan 2, 2006\" }}</time></span></a>\n\n        <div class=\"e-content\">\n         \t{{ .Content }}\n        </div>\n      </li>\n    {{ end }}\n  </ul>\n\n  <p class=\"rss-subscribe\">subscribe <a href=\"{{ \"feed.xml\" | absURL }}\">via RSS</a></p>\n\n</div>\n{{ end }}\n```\n\n\n~~[^1]: I'm not sure if this is all necessary or even the right way to go about it. It seems pretty involved and I don't even know how you would migrate your customizations in an easy way if you happen to have used the old style of choosing a theme‚Ä¶ but this way works, that much I could prove.~~\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I barely can watch movies anymore. This has less to do with problems of changing aesthetics and me being unable to adapt (, although maybe a little bit). It‚Äôs more about it getting harder and harder to suspend my disbelief. An example from last night: I tried to watch ‚ÄûDon‚Äôt look up‚Äú but got so infuriated by the depiction of how things would supposedly work, that I couldn‚Äôt enjoy an otherwise interesting idea. I guess I just don‚Äôt like when a movie‚Äôs plotting is dependent on unrealistic premises, especially when it claims to start from a place of (somewhat heightened) realism. Things should make sense within the confines of its world. If our actual world builds the backbone of the movie‚Äôs world then you gotta show the work that‚Äôs happening why things are different than we normally would expect them to be. Show me the work. This is not the same as asking for everything to be explained. I am simply asking for potential plausibility. Handwaving in the right spots is of course part of storytelling.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe it‚Äôs because I have studied history of science and technology, have been working in the literature studies department while I was studying and am now working as a programmer that I am therefore primed to notice and dislike such inconsistencies. I prefer nonfiction, memoirs and sociologically interesting sci-fi. Works that do not reduce the interesting complexities of our world to tell a story that doesn‚Äôt shy away from the effort to be plausible.</p>\n\n<p>I think that this happens to me more frequently now, is because I am much more time- and attention-constrained. I do not have the resources after a long day to consume too many things that ask me to do the work of ‚Äûmaking it work‚Äú. I also have less chances to consume anything at all the older I get and the more responsibilities I have and am therefore more discerning on what I spend my time on. ‚ÄûTried and true‚Äú is often the answer. So no wonder that watching sports have become such a big part of my life instead of artistic works. I also prefer a solid but consistent tv show over an at times brilliant but otherwise disappointing one. I assess consuming media more and more from a standpoint of how risky it is: How likely will I be disappointed? I already have lists of lists of things I would like to do. If I decide to try something new, it better be worth it. And: It seldom is.</p>\n\n<p>There is a ratcheting effect built in this way of consuming media: You do more and more of the same and less and less of the new. If it was only me I would even prefer such a bias, but it also has consequences for enjoying things like movies and tv shows together with my partner. So I end up giving chances to things I would have not considered. Maybe that‚Äôs good. Things shouldn‚Äôt be too predictable either. But boy, do many, many things suffer from a lack of plausibility‚Ä¶</p>\n",

But corgis (Pembrokes and to a lesser extent Cardigans) are trendy at the moment. As are smaller dogs in general. The Corona pandemic made this even more pronounced and I can't blame people. If people can't leave their homes for a long time it becomes more likely for them to focus on improving their immediate surroundings, their environment. I could see that this reevaluation might lead to wanting things to stay different: More people wanting pets is a probable result, I think.\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/44388/2021/c47b1f38f7.jpg)\n\nHaving a pet is a nice thing, I imagine. I grew up with a Labrador Retriever called Lucy. Notice that I said \"grew up with\", not \"had\". Not because I want to underline that Lucy was a family member (she totally was), but because it was not *my* dog. It was my dad's dog. I can't fault him, but it always hurt me a little. The way he told stories about his dog. The way he took his dog with him after the divorce. I got it and I get it. But this observation made me think \"I wanna have a dog, too!\"\n\nMany years passed where having a dog would have been impractical, irresponsible or outright impossible. I buried the idea for almost a decade. If I referred to this wish of mine I said \"When I'm 30 I'm gonna get a dog\". Getting closer to the end of my time at university, around 27, the wish resurfaced. Unclear where I was going to live and with what I was going to make my money, this little itch came back. I want a dog. And not just since yesterday. Now I'm 35. I feel like it's time.\n",

				"title": "On Quoting And Commenting",
				"content_html": "<p>Today I discovered <a href=\"https://manuelmoreale.com\">Manuel Moreale&rsquo;s Blog</a> thanks to this great endorsement by <a href=\"https://micro.blog/uncertainquark\">@uncertainquark</a> (which I in turn found thanks to micro.blog&rsquo;s discovery tab):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I just donated to a personal blog writer I really like. Check out his very human blog, which actually cares about the state of the Internet: manuelmoreale.com üìù</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of the posts there (<a href=\"https://manuelmoreale.com/thoughts/on-discovery-and-consumption\">On discovery and consumption</a>) made me pause when I was thinking about how to react to this beautifully little post by <a href=\"https://micro.blog/pimoore\">@pimoore</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Who we are is the most eloquent and unique story that we all write every single day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is a difference between commenting and quoting a post like this. Since that post was inspiration to a point (<em>this</em>) I wanted to make, I don&rsquo;t think that a comment would have been appropriate. Looking at the comments other people actually made, they are engaging with the post more directly, by uttering e.g. approval (for example, <a href=\"https://micro.blog/patrickrhone\">@patrickrhone</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Truth&rdquo;)</p>\n<p>There is also a difference in the way I engage with the post when quoting it: The engagement here is very indirect, the other person does not even necessarily notice that I took what they wrote and re-contextualized it for my own needs.</p>\n<p>Similarly to Manuel Morale&rsquo;s point about discovery and consumption, this might be an obvious difference. But I think commenting and quoting also is related to what Manuel has to say about the centralization of discovery and consumption (meaning the engagement with the discovered content):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One major change the web has experienced was the consolidation of discovery and consumption. Digg was‚Äîand still is‚Äîa place to discover new content but the consumption of that content takes place away outside of Digg.\nAnd the same was true for discussions around the content. Those used to happen in comment sections spread across the internet. But now, places like Twitter or Instagram are acting as places for both the discovery and the consumption of new content.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A platform that only allows comments about content linked from elsewhere on the web will not lead to this kind of centralization. A comment-only platform like this is also much less convenient to use to actually build upon other people&rsquo;s content, which most often happens in the quoting (or linking) style instead the commenting-style of engagement.</p>\n<p>Making it easier to quote other people&rsquo;s content might on the other hand have consequences as regards to how we engage with the creators behind the content. Which brings me to another post of Manuel (<a href=\"https://manuelmoreale.com/the-internet-is-not-broken-people-are\">The internet is not broken. People are.</a>), which is that social media exposes a lot of people&rsquo;s interest not in doing the thing for the love of the thing, but for the fame, which might be achieved through it (Something I have always appreciated about <a href=\"https://micro.blog/merlinmann\">@merlinmann</a>: He does the things because he loves doing them).</p>\n<p>A commenter is not very likely to become famous through commenting. A quoter on the other hand produces first order content: This post here stands on its own, even though it is inspired by other content.

				"content_text": "Today I discovered [Manuel Moreale's Blog](https://manuelmoreale.com) thanks to this great endorsement by [@uncertainquark](https://micro.blog/uncertainquark) (which I in turn found thanks to micro.blog's discovery tab):\n\n>I just donated to a personal blog writer I really like. Check out his very human blog, which actually cares about the state of the Internet: manuelmoreale.com üìù\n\nOne of the posts there ([On discovery and consumption](https://manuelmoreale.com/thoughts/on-discovery-and-consumption)) made me pause when I was thinking about how to react to this beautifully little post by [@pimoore](https://micro.blog/pimoore):\n\n>Who we are is the most eloquent and unique story that we all write every single day. \n\nThere is a difference between commenting and quoting a post like this. Since that post was inspiration to a point (_this_) I wanted to make, I don't think that a comment would have been appropriate. Looking at the comments other people actually made, they are engaging with the post more directly, by uttering e.g. approval (for example, [@patrickrhone](https://micro.blog/patrickrhone)'s \"Truth\") \n\nThere is also a difference in the way I engage with the post when quoting it: The engagement here is very indirect, the other person does not even necessarily notice that I took what they wrote and re-contextualized it for my own needs.\n\nSimilarly to Manuel Morale's point about discovery and consumption, this might be an obvious difference. But I think commenting and quoting also is related to what Manuel has to say about the centralization of discovery and consumption (meaning the engagement with the discovered content):\n\n>One major change the web has experienced was the consolidation of discovery and consumption. Digg was‚Äîand still is‚Äîa place to discover new content but the consumption of that content takes place away outside of Digg.\nAnd the same was true for discussions around the content. Those used to happen in comment sections spread across the internet. But now, places like Twitter or Instagram are acting as places for both the discovery and the consumption of new content.\n\nA platform that only allows comments about content linked from elsewhere on the web will not lead to this kind of centralization. A comment-only platform like this is also much less convenient to use to actually build upon other people's content, which most often happens in the quoting (or linking) style instead the commenting-style of engagement.\n\nMaking it easier to quote other people's content might on the other hand have consequences as regards to how we engage with the creators behind the content. Which brings me to another post of Manuel ([The internet is not broken. People are.](https://manuelmoreale.com/the-internet-is-not-broken-people-are)), which is that social media exposes a lot of people's interest not in doing the thing for the love of the thing, but for the fame, which might be achieved through it (Something I have always appreciated about [@merlinmann](https://micro.blog/merlinmann): He does the things because he loves doing them).\n\nA commenter is not very likely to become famous through commenting. A quoter on the other hand produces first order content: This post here stands on its own, even though it is inspired by other content. Combined with the strong network effects of the big social media platforms, odds are that the wish for fame becomes more likely to surface - because fame itself is more probable in these conditions.\n\nTherefore offering tools for quoting, for building upon other people's content, is a double edged sword. If the social media platform is too big and quoting is too easy, there is an increased likelihood of a bloodless hunt for fame, in which first order creators become increasingly invisible to each other.\n",

To continue the theme, I recently listened to Joan Didion&rsquo;s Books: The Year of Magical Thinking and Let Me Tell You What I Mean.</p>\n<p>The Year of Magical Thinking is a memoir of an especially tumultuous year in her life. After the sudden death of her husband and the hospitalization of her daughter, Didion finds herself detached from reality and has to claw herself back to reason. There is a certain sharpness in the way she puts things, a certain breathlessness in the intelligence with which she follows the paths of her own thoughts while mourning the loss of a writing partner and spouse (a parallel to Hampl&rsquo;s book).</p>\n<p>We see here a woman who is smart, quick and in control of her faculties wanting to fight and having to accept, that there is no real shortcut, no swift way to skip the all too human need to just feel shitty for a while, to be scared, to be upset, to not know, to maybe not even understand why your own seemingly better argument, the pointed question or educated guess doesn&rsquo;t cut it. To be clear, what Didion focusses on is not this desire to skip the lowly emotions and loss of control that are part of the human condition. But, to me, she exemplifies how hard it is to accept the necessity of being a passenger, not the driver, for a while after an event like this.</p>\n<p>One strength of Didion&rsquo;s writing is that she can put a finger on the power of slightly changed emphases. Like in her text &ldquo;Everywoman.com&rdquo; about Martha Stewart and her empire from the second book of her&rsquo;s I have listened to: Let Me Tell You What I Mean, a collection of essays from 1968 to 2000.</p>\n<p>In Everywoman.com she turns the critique on Martha Stewart, a home maker turned CEO of a billion dollar company, inside out. The critique goes something like this: Martha Stewart is a fraud, because she pretends to be a simple homemaker, like her fans, even though in reality she is a driven business woman who created merely an artifice of being a homemaker. Didion is directing her more empathetic read of Stewart mainly against Jerry Oppenheimer&rsquo;s unauthorized investigative Book on her: Just Desserts. Opposed to Oppenheimer, Didion concludes that Stewart&rsquo;s success, Artifice and all, are inspirational to US-American women because Stewart managed to create her own rags to riches story: from homemaker to CEO.</p>\n<p>One thing I picked up and that is eerily related to her empathy for Stewart is her own success. I stumbled upon the following <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2XO43HUDM9UHF/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=1400078431\">review of The Year of Magical Thinking on Amazon</a> that is an example of what I mean:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>She certainly went through losses that would make anyone stagger.

She recounts good times in a long marriage that involves luxurious travels and freedom gained through wealth. Can&rsquo;t relate. Am I jealous? Probably.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Didion is well off, that much is clear. She has been a successful writer for a long time and coming up in a much more socially mobile era, she ended up being wealthy. The question is: Does this take away from her writing? And the answer is: Yes, a little bit. I wouldn&rsquo;t go so far to suggest that I can&rsquo;t relate or that what she has to say is not interesting, quiet the opposite, but because Didion&rsquo;s voice is one of careful reexamination (it reminds of the idiom &ldquo;show me, I&rsquo;m from Missouri&rdquo;) and her reputation is one of popularizing counter culture, of problematizing the American Dream I can&rsquo;t deny that the success, although earned, subverts a little bit her persona, her self-conception or the frame from which I read her (so maybe, probably, this is on me). It complicates the relationship between me, the reader (or listener in my case), and her, the counter culture writer. Now, I am not owed an uncomplicated relationship. But I do have to admit that the contrast of a now wealthy writer that came from a place of socially conscious reporting - and still has those instincts but lives a totally different life - lead to some cognitive dissonance. It totally makes sense that lives like this exist. She is not the first, nor the last that will have had also monetary success from writing empathetically about various social issues.

				"content_html": "<p>When I was looking through my DayOne posts - the recent acquisition of the journaling app by automattic made me curious; I had not been using the app in a couple of years - I stumbled upon a journal entry that included a few screenshots of tweets that a quite popular German political Twitterer (maybe 30k followers back then, now around 50k followers) had posted, that berated me fiercely. How stupid I was and how dare I speak up against this person. They called me a baboon that needed to be put into place amongst other things. I think they called me sexist, too. I didn&rsquo;t have the heart to plunge deeper into the post. As I was simply too shocked. I had completely forgotten about this life altering experience half a decade ago. But here it was. And the remembering began.</p>\n<p>What had happened? When I was studying history of science and technology I was not shy to speak up. I was a young man that deemed himself smart and with a talent for research. I also had way too much time on my hands, which made me &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; in class. I read and studied furiously. And what I learned I wanted to apply. That is, nothing went past me in class. Any little uncertainty that came up, I problematized - to the frustration of my professors, I&rsquo;m sure, as well as my classmates. I wanted to be a researcher, or no, I wanted to be a prodigy. A person with great potential to become an exceptional researcher. I dreamt big. And I wanted my professors to see how smart I was. I had this dream that somebody would take me under their wing, make me behave, by offering a path to a career in research. I wanted to be tamed, I think, so that I could become the beautiful, creative researcher that I thought I ought to be.</p>\n<p>In any case, this phase of my life was a messy one and so were the discussions in the seminars. Lots of arguments, lots and lots of monologuing on my part. Oh, my poor classmates, forgive me! But that&rsquo;s who I was back then and although I look back with shame, I would be lying if I would not point out that this time of my life was one of the most instructive phases of it as well.</p>\n<p>I remember neither subject of the course nor the specific book introduction, chapter or article that we were assigned to read for this weeks class. What I do remember is that I disagreed vehemently with the author&rsquo;s premise that nobody had as of yet <em>really</em> looked into the topic at hand, except herself. That the author was female was incidental to my disagreement. But I never liked this take. To me, history was all about uncovering more and more aspects of the past. And a new take was adding a new shade, a new layer to the beautiful complexities of historiography as it related to the topic at hand. There is no singular fundamental take on history that subsumes all other takes - or at least not for long. History is best, I thought, if it was a humbling exercise, one in which your own strong opinions and values get somewhat relativized. History, to me, was a quest for authenticity, for serious inquiry, that ought not to bend to the political fashions of the day - even if I happen to agree with them. History ought to be historicist, in the German sense, where the understanding of a happening stems from a process of trying to find plausibility in the actions through sympathy for the actors - no matter how vile their behavior would be deemed, probably rightfully so, in our time. In short I was a young man looking for authenticity in a world full of ironic takes. I craved sincerity. &ldquo;Be real with me&rdquo;, I thought often, &ldquo;I want to like you&rdquo;. &ldquo;I want to be sure that you like me&rdquo;, if you say so, too. I was lonely and longed for reliability.</p>\n<p>It was well known amongst history of science students back then, that we had a minor celebrity in our midst. This person was a young politician of some clout. An up-and-comer that had gotten a taste of political authority, of respect towards their own person, after being elected to the city&rsquo;s parliament. They were invited to talk shows and interviewed a few times for TV and radio back then. They carried the aura of demanding respect into our classroom as well. Wearing nice long woolen coats, good fitting suits and expensive looking scarfs, not at all what the rest of us normals wore and especially not me, the wild man in the shabby cloths. They were standing out. They had understood that clothes make the person. At the same time their public persona was one of irony, of trolling for the greater good, or what they perceived as the greater good. They were a postmodern politician. One that always seemed to play both sides of the un/certainty coin: Claiming &ldquo;Facts first!&rdquo; but being crowned troll of the year some years earlier.</p>\n<p>The actual quarrel around which I have been circulating for this handful of paragraphs is explained quickly: My adversary had read the text different than me - or not differently, but more affirmatively. The claim of a fundamental take did not repel them, quite the opposite. They bought the author&rsquo;s points about what others had overlooked, maybe they bought the idea of a perfect all-encompassing historical take as well? I wasn&rsquo;t sure back then, but I was sure that history doesn&rsquo;t bend to a totalitarian approach. Writing history is a process of picking and choosing, of simplification. So I argued against their notion, vehemently. That the author had a feminist viewpoint - which was so incidental to my points - became the linchpin of the discussion. To this day I am sure of this: Even a struggle so central to modern societal progress as equality can only ever be an aspect of historiography. You may base a whole career on feminist history - and that would be an important pursuit - but nobody would claim everything is said and done when we have told all there is to tell about this struggle. No. No! And again: No!</p>\n<p>I would like to claim that I stayed as calm as I am now, writing all this down however many years later, but that would be a lie. We shouted at each other. I didn&rsquo;t permit this person, or my professor for that matter, to have the last word. I was incapable to give in, to allow this person to lug his intimidating aura around to steamroll me. After all, this was academia! Or its impoverished simulacrum at least. And arguments ought to count more than any accomplishments in other arenas of society here. Finally, the person just left in the middle of the class, infuriated, slamming the door. I was about to make another remark about their bad attitude, but was silenced by my professor: &ldquo;Martin!&rdquo; He only shouted this one word. My name. &ldquo;Martin!&rdquo; &ldquo;There it was&rdquo;, I thought. Finally an acknowledgement. I felt oddly good. I felt put into place. And wasn&rsquo;t this what I wanted? To be put into place?</p>\n<p>A few hours later, still pumped up from the altercation, I learned that my opponent had posted the tweets they did. I don&rsquo;t think they assumed that I was a Twitter user or would seek ought their timeline - if they cared at all. I found myself in an exceptional situation: I could read what another person that didn&rsquo;t like me thought about me. They just had put it out there for anyone to read. That included me and their kinda big audience. Some people liked those tweets, others retweeted them. And even though I knew, intellectually, that these tweets weren&rsquo;t meant for me or were in the end about me, really (they were about this persons anger), I felt deeply hurt. I felt seen, in a bad way. I felt revealed, caught. I felt like I was laughable. The whole village, <em>their</em> village, had it out for me, pointing, be it in anger or amusement about this anti-feminist idiot, who came to town, unbidden, to insult the mayor with his retrograde ideas, the fool, not even able to see how antiprogressive he is. I felt my artifice was visible as such. The political ascriptions didn&rsquo;t bother me, because they weren&rsquo;t accurate. But the persona that was described between the lines did. This mess of piled up insecurities that held up the disguise of an eager student was laid bare. There I was, in my most unfavorable interpretation. However, I couldn&rsquo;t deny the fact that it was a possible interpretation. It had a connection to reality. Yes, I was a self-serious jerk. And I knew it, I realized it, sometimes. And in this moment, I could see it clearly, I wasn&rsquo;t the only one who was aware. I felt deeply ashamed.</p>\n<p>As though a pill as it is swallow to remember all of this, to rethink all of this: I am grateful that I had the strength back then to screenshot those tweets and put them into my journal. I don&rsquo;t know if I knew it back then, but I preserved a seminal moment in my life. There is no real moral here. And I couldn&rsquo;t point to this vignette as the cause for things being different from there on out. I carried on a couple of years longer with this prodigy-jerk persona, before it finally clicked that this wasn&rsquo;t the way. Erosion takes its time. But I will always think back to this moment in my life when thinking about where the beginning of the end of that persona is located. It&rsquo;s right then and there. I am a better person for it today, prodigy or not.</p>\n",

I had this dream that somebody would take me under their wing, make me behave, by offering a path to a career in research. I wanted to be tamed, I think, so that I could become the beautiful, creative researcher that I thought I ought to be.\n\nIn any case, this phase of my life was a messy one and so were the discussions in the seminars. Lots of arguments, lots and lots of monologuing on my part. Oh, my poor classmates, forgive me! But that's who I was back then and although I look back with shame, I would be lying if I would not point out that this time of my life was one of the most instructive phases of it as well.\n\nI remember neither subject of the course nor the specific book introduction, chapter or article that we were assigned to read for this weeks class. What I do remember is that I disagreed vehemently with the author's premise that nobody had as of yet *really* looked into the topic at hand, except herself. That the author was female was incidental to my disagreement. But I never liked this take. To me, history was all about uncovering more and more aspects of the past. And a new take was adding a new shade, a new layer to the beautiful complexities of historiography as it related to the topic at hand. There is no singular fundamental take on history that subsumes all other takes - or at least not for long. History is best, I thought, if it was a humbling exercise, one in which your own strong opinions and values get somewhat relativized. History, to me, was a quest for authenticity, for serious inquiry, that ought not to bend to the political fashions of the day - even if I happen to agree with them. History ought to be historicist, in the German sense, where the understanding of a happening stems from a process of trying to find plausibility in the actions through sympathy for the actors - no matter how vile their behavior would be deemed, probably rightfully so, in our time. In short I was a young man looking for authenticity in a world full of ironic takes. I craved sincerity. \"Be real with me\", I thought often, \"I want to like you\". \"I want to be sure that you like me\", if you say so, too. I was lonely and longed for reliability.\n\nIt was well known amongst history of science students back then, that we had a minor celebrity in our midst. This person was a young politician of some clout. An up-and-comer that had gotten a taste of political authority, of respect towards their own person, after being elected to the city's parliament. They were invited to talk shows and interviewed a few times for TV and radio back then. They carried the aura of demanding respect into our classroom as well. Wearing nice long woolen coats, good fitting suits and expensive looking scarfs, not at all what the rest of us normals wore and especially not me, the wild man in the shabby cloths. They were standing out. They had understood that clothes make the person. At the same time their public persona was one of irony, of trolling for the greater good, or what they perceived as the greater good. They were a postmodern politician. One that always seemed to play both sides of the un/certainty coin: Claiming \"Facts first!\" but being crowned troll of the year some years earlier.\n\nThe actual quarrel around which I have been circulating for this handful of paragraphs is explained quickly: My adversary had read the text different than me - or not differently, but more affirmatively. The claim of a fundamental take did not repel them, quite the opposite. They bought the author's points about what others had overlooked, maybe they bought the idea of a perfect all-encompassing historical take as well? I wasn't sure back then, but I was sure that history doesn't bend to a totalitarian approach. Writing history is a process of picking and choosing, of simplification. So I argued against their notion, vehemently. That the author had a feminist viewpoint - which was so incidental to my points - became the linchpin of the discussion. To this day I am sure of this: Even a struggle so central to modern societal progress as equality can only ever be an aspect of historiography. You may base a whole career on feminist history - and that would be an important pursuit - but nobody would claim everything is said and done when we have told all there is to tell about this struggle. No. No! And again: No!\n\nI would like to claim that I stayed as calm as I am now, writing all this down however many years later, but that would be a lie. We shouted at each other. I didn't permit this person, or my professor for that matter, to have the last word. I was incapable to give in, to allow this person to lug his intimidating aura around to steamroll me. After all, this was academia! Or its impoverished simulacrum at least. And arguments ought to count more than any accomplishments in other arenas of society here. Finally, the person just left in the middle of the class, infuriated, slamming the door. I was about to make another remark about their bad attitude, but was silenced by my professor: \"Martin!\" He only shouted this one word. My name. \"Martin!\" \"There it was\", I thought. Finally an acknowledgement. I felt oddly good. I felt put into place. And wasn't this what I wanted? To be put into place?\n\nA few hours later, still pumped up from the altercation, I learned that my opponent had posted the tweets they did. I don't think they assumed that I was a Twitter user or would seek ought their timeline - if they cared at all. I found myself in an exceptional situation: I could read what another person that didn't like me thought about me. They just had put it out there for anyone to read. That included me and their kinda big audience. Some people liked those tweets, others retweeted them. And even though I knew, intellectually, that these tweets weren't meant for me or were in the end about me, really (they were about this persons anger), I felt deeply hurt. I felt seen, in a bad way. I felt revealed, caught. I felt like I was laughable. The whole village, *their* village, had it out for me, pointing, be it in anger or amusement about this anti-feminist idiot, who came to town, unbidden, to insult the mayor with his retrograde ideas, the fool, not even able to see how antiprogressive he is. I felt my artifice was visible as such. The political ascriptions didn't bother me, because they weren't accurate. But the persona that was described between the lines did. This mess of piled up insecurities that held up the disguise of an eager student was laid bare. There I was, in my most unfavorable interpretation. However, I couldn't deny the fact that it was a possible interpretation. It had a connection to reality. Yes, I was a self-serious jerk. And I knew it, I realized it, sometimes. And in this moment, I could see it clearly, I wasn't the only one who was aware. I felt deeply ashamed.\n\nAs though a pill as it is swallow to remember all of this, to rethink all of this: I am grateful that I had the strength back then to screenshot those tweets and put them into my journal. I don't know if I knew it back then, but I preserved a seminal moment in my life. There is no real moral here. And I couldn't point to this vignette as the cause for things being different from there on out. I carried on a couple of years longer with this prodigy-jerk persona, before it finally clicked that this wasn't the way. Erosion takes its time. But I will always think back to this moment in my life when thinking about where the beginning of the end of that persona is located. It's right then and there. I am a better person for it today, prodigy or not.\n",
